	      "text": "Kabul (AFP) - A roadside bomb killed an American soldier Tuesday near the capital of Afghanistan's volatile Helmand province, following the first major US deployment to the southern city since foreign forces withdrew in 2014. The blast, which occurred during an anti-Taliban operation, left another American and six Afghan soldiers wounded, the US-led NATO coalition said.\nThe casualties came just a day after NATO announced the deployment of around 100 US troops to Lashkar Gah to help head off a potential Taliban takeover of Helmand's capital as fighting intensifies.\n\"One US service member died as a result of wounds sustained during operations near Lashkar Gah in Helmand,\" NATO said in a statement.\n\"The service member was killed conducting train, advise, assist activities with Afghan counterparts under NATO authorities when their patrol triggered an improvised explosive device.\"\nThe Pentagon said the troop's identity would be released after family were notified.\nIt marks the first American combat fatality in the country since January, when a US soldier was killed while conducting a mission with Afghan special forces in Helmand's Marjah district.\n\"This tragic event in Helmand province reminds us that Afghanistan remains a dangerous place, and there is difficult work ahead even as Afghan forces continue to make progress in securing their own country,\" US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said in a statement.\nNATO said the soldier was not part of the new deployment to Lashkar Gah, which the coalition has called a \"temporary effort\" to train and advise local forces.\nThere are currently around 700 US troops in Helmand as part of a similar counter-insurgency training mission, NATO said.\nFighting has recently escalated in the opium-growing province, with insurgents coming within a few kilometres of Lashkar Gah -- raising fears the city is at risk of falling.\n- 'Serious' Taliban offensive -\nThe turmoil convulsing Helmand, blighted by a huge opium harvest that helps fund the insurgency, underscores a rapidly unravelling security situation in Afghanistan.\nFighting has left thousands of people displaced in Helmand in recent weeks, sparking a humanitarian crisis as officials report food and water shortages.\nThe Taliban have also closed in on Kunduz -- the northern city they briefly seized last year in their biggest military victory so far -- leaving Afghan forces stretched on multiple fronts.\n\"This is a big effort by the Taliban. It's probably the most serious push we've seen of the (fighting) season,\" said NATO spokesman Brigadier General Charles Cleveland.\nBut coalition forces have insisted that neither Kunduz nor Lashkar Gah are at risk of falling to the insurgents.\nNATO officially ended its combat mission in December 2014, but US forces were granted greater powers in June to strike at the insurgents as President Barack Obama vowed a more aggressive campaign.\nThe US intervention in Helmand has fuelled the perception that foreign powers are increasingly being drawn back into the conflict as Afghan forces struggle to rein in the Taliban.\nThe fighting in Helmand comes as Afghan troops are stretched on several other battlefronts across Afghanistan -- including the eastern province of Nangarhar, where the Islamic State group is making inroads.",

	      "text": "U.S. | Wed Aug 24, 2016 10:04am EDT Special Report: How Delaware kept America safe for corporate secrecy Jeffrey Bullock, the appointed secretary of state of Delaware. Courtesy State of Delaware By Suzanne Barlyn | DOVER, Delaware, \nDOVER, Delaware, In 2009, a global coalition was pressing governments to lift the veil on corporate secrecy. Its members – U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration, influential senators, international law enforcement agencies, anti-corruption activists and major American allies -- presented a formidable front in their campaign against money laundering and tax evasion. \nThe United States, championing the cause abroad, was also pursuing legislation for stronger disclosure rules at home. \nThen along came Jeffrey Bullock, the newly appointed secretary of state for Delaware. \nHis tiny East Coast state was in crisis, heading toward an $800 million budget deficit. Delaware’s second-biggest biggest source of revenue was fees from few-questions-asked company registrations and other corporate services. That cash cow was in danger. \nA proposed U.S. law would have required states to track the true owners of the companies they register. The global pushback against shell companies was threatening to dim Delaware’s longstanding appeal as a secretive corporate domicile. \nSeven years later, the proposed law continues to languish, thanks in part to Bullock. He was neither the first nor the only official to take up the fight, but became a leader in defending the status quo as worldwide support for change gained traction. It’s as easy as ever to register a company in Delaware with scant disclosure of the real owner, making the state a magnet for anonymous shell companies that law enforcement says can be used to avoid taxes, launder money from drug-trafficking or conceal terrorist financing. \n“We’re viewed as hypocrites,” said Carl Levin, the now-retired Michigan senator who sponsored the legislation and an advocate of corporate transparency in his 36 years on Capitol Hill. “We go after tax havens and people who launder money … but then we become a haven.” His bill received fresh support this month, in a letter from a coalition of the world’s largest banks to U.S. lawmakers. The legislation’s prospects remain unclear. \nDelaware, meanwhile, is doing much better. Since Bullock started his job, the number of companies registered in Delaware has jumped 34 percent, to 1,181,000 as of last year. Revenue from the state’s corporations unit surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2015. In 2010, the state budget deficit was $800 million; as of this July, it was zero. Rising fee income from registrations, which surged during Bullock’s tenure, helped plug the gap. \nEven before Bullock was appointed, officials from several states were working to address the growing sentiment against corporate secrecy. And Delaware took some steps to curb secrecy, such as tightening oversight of “registered agents,” third parties who act on behalf of companies. But Bullock helped outmaneuver foes of the status quo by tapping his political connections, drumming up support among other states and hiring a Washington lobbying firm. \nIn an interview, Bullock said corporate secrecy in the United States is a problem and that law enforcement needs tools to uncover the identities of company owners. He opposed past efforts to deal with the problem, he said, because they would have placed undue burdens on individual states. The federal government, not states, should be responsible for making the system more transparent, he said. \nTHE COST OF OPACITY \nLeaving states to collect ownership information, Bullock said, could leave weak links in the system by creating a patchwork of different approaches and financial resources for collecting those details. \n“And criminals can find the weakest link,” he said. \nThe vast majority of Delaware-registered companies are legitimate enterprises. More than 50 percent of all U.S. publicly traded companies and 66 percent of the Fortune 500 call Delaware home, according to the Delaware Division of Corporations. \nStill, the opacity championed by Delaware and other states has allowed some notorious criminals to carry out their deeds and hide ill-gotten gains. \nLobbyist Jack Abramoff laundered money defrauded from clients through a Delaware shell company run by a lifeguard out of a beach house. Mexico cartel kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman allegedly used a Delaware-based tequila business to launder drug money. Former Zambia strongman Frederick Chiluba siphoned off millions from state coffers into Delaware shell companies. The list goes on. \nBullock’s reach extends into the offices of his counterparts in other states who, at Delaware’s direction, lobby their U.S. representatives to fight transparency, said Heather Lowe, director of government affairs at Global Financial Integrity, an anti-corruption advocacy group in Washington, D.C. Bullock’s influence is “astoundingly frustrating,” Lowe said. \nIt’s impossible for authorities to determine exactly how much dirty money is tucked away in havens. Based on an analysis of International Monetary Fund data, Global Financial Integrity says that roughly $1.1 trillion in illicit funds were transferred out of developing countries in 2013. \nWHERE COMPANIES WANT TO BE \nCorporate America has long favored Delaware as a domicile because of statutes that give directors broad discretion in how they run companies, a dedicated court for corporate disputes that dates to 1792, and a business-friendly legislature. Delaware was the first state to let stockholders limit the liability of corporate directors. \nDelaware is also one of the world’s easiest places to set up a company. The state charges as little as $90 to register a limited liability corporation, or LLC. All that’s needed is the name of a registered agent, which can be bought from an outside company for $50. Approximately 200 agents represent Delaware’s 1.2 million companies. “Form Your Delaware Company in Just Minutes,” touts the website for one of them, Harvard Business Services Inc. \nWhen law enforcement officials, or anyone else, search Delaware’s corporate registry online to see who owns a company, all they get is the name and address of the agent. The true owner, also known as the beneficial owner, doesn’t have to be disclosed. \nThe Corporations Division of Delaware’s Department of State comprises a warren of cubicles in the basement of a government building in Dover, the state capital. The division’s 111 employees man two shifts, working until midnight to accommodate urgent corporate filings. For $1,000, the office will vet a corporate registration application in an hour, taking requests as late as 9 p.m. \nBullock was raised in Claymont, a steel town whose fortunes fell with the collapse of the U.S. steel industry. He came up in local politics, landing a gig as chief of staff to then-Governor Tom Carper in the 1990s. Delaware’s current governor, Jack Markell, appointed Bullock secretary of state in 2009. \nIt was a bleak time for Delaware, in the wake of the global financial crisis. By 2010, the state’s budget was deep in the red. State leaders were wrestling with the equally unappealing prospects of deep spending cuts and steep tax hikes. \nWorse, Delaware’s corporate registry franchise, its biggest revenue driver after personal income tax, was in jeopardy. \nAMERICA THE OUTLIER \nIn 2006, the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, a group of some three dozen nations formed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, noted “significant shortcomings” in the United States. The group declared Washington “non-compliant” in four of 40 categories for anti-money-laundering compliance. Among the failures: Authorities could not obtain timely information about a company’s real owners, FATF said. \nThe task force demanded that the United States fix the problem. For Washington, which was pressing allies to crack down on terror financing, it was an embarrassing critique. \nThe same year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’s auditing arm, concluded that federal law made it too easy for individuals to anonymously form companies. Delaware was a favored destination for such companies, the report said. \nAs anti-secrecy momentum built, Senator Levin and then-Senator Barack Obama joined forces with Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota to make it tougher to register new companies without identifying the owners. \nThey issued a bill in 2008 that would pare back secrecy laws in Delaware and other states by forcing them to collect information about the true owners of companies, thereby making the facts more accessible to law enforcement. \nIn 2009, the Department of Justice, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Manhattan District Attorney’s office each testified to a Senate committee that corporate secrecy was a growing problem and impeding law enforcement. \nCHAMPIONING THE CAUSE \nBy then, Bullock had been appointed secretary of state. Trim and friendly, he became a popular figure, tasked with praising the state’s founders in speeches on “Delaware Day” and flanking the governor at bill-signing ceremonies. \nHe pursued a weightier agenda behind the scenes. By May 2009, he had hired Washington lobbying firm Peck Madigan Jones to sway lawmakers and administration officials against Levin’s bill. One of the partners, Jonathon Jones, had served as Governor Carper’s chief of staff after Bullock. Bullock is the only secretary of state in the country with a taxpayer-funded lobbying firm, according to lobbying disclosures. \nBullock said the firm’s main role was to lobby on the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reforms. Peck Madigan didn’t return calls seeking comment. \nBullock then hit back against FATF, the multinational group that had slammed Delaware as a secrecy haven. \nHe co-wrote a Sept. 16, 2011, letter to FATF on behalf of the National Association of Secretaries of State in which he called the group’s recommendations “impractical,” warning it not to meddle with “the core principle of Constitutional state sovereignty.” Such letters from association leaders are not unusual, a NASS spokesperson said. \nMeanwhile, Levin made a tactical misstep. He introduced his bill in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, where an influential member was Delaware Senator Tom Carper - Bullock’s old chum and former boss. \nThe bill was the subject of two hearings in 2009, tying it up for six months. Carper testified against it, saying states shouldn’t be burdened with more work. \n“I have long believed it should be easier for law enforcement to access identity information about criminals who manipulate our corporate laws,” Carper said in a statement to Reuters. But new rules to ease access should preserve “a nurturing” business environment, he said. \nSTUCK IN THE SENATE \nLevin reintroduced a more detailed bill in late 2011 with ramped-up identification checks. The Treasury endorsed it. \nThis time, according to a former congressional staffer, Carper pressed Senator Joe Lieberman, the committee chairman, to let the bill languish. When the bill was scheduled for a markup, the final step before going to the full Senate for debate and a possible vote, it never came to pass, the staffer said. \nLieberman, in an email, said Carper and other committee senators voiced concerns about the bill. “It was my impression that they were hearing from their states’ secretaries,” Lieberman said. Lieberman said he asked the senators to compromise. “They tried but were never able to find the sweet spot of an agreement. And that’s where it ended,” said Lieberman, now a lawyer in private practice. \nIn June 2013, pressure rose on Washington to act. The Group of Eight industrialized nations issued a declaration demanding that members curtail anonymous shell companies. The plan called for creating ownership registries to aid authorities. That month, President Obama issued a national plan to address the G8 concerns, including a call for the Treasury Department and other agencies to back measures against anonymous shells. \nLevin retooled his bill yet again in August 2013. It had yet to make it to the Senate floor for debate, five years after it was introduced. This time, he crafted it for consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, hoping for a better reception. \nBy then, NASS, where Bullock had become a dominant voice, was pushing a counterproposal. It advocated addressing the issue by relying on information the Internal Revenue Service collects from companies. \nThat wouldn’t work, critics said. The IRS has long restricted the information it gives law enforcement, they said. Further, the IRS requires only that companies register “responsible parties,” a term that could include anyone -- even a lawyer duty-bound to hide the real owner’s identity. \nIt “was a cover to oppose a bill that’s presumably aimed at the true owners of corporations,” Levin told Reuters. “It’s a dodge.” \nAGENTS FOR CHANGE \nNASS spokeswoman Kay Stimson said the IRS collects the same kind of information described in the Levin bill. Law enforcement officials, she said, have told NASS that the IRS data is sufficient. \nIn 2013, two retired FBI special agents took up the cause against secrecy, serving as unofficial spokespeople for active agents. Dennis Lormel and Theodore Greenberg, with decades of experience working anti-money laundering cases between them, visited Bullock in his offices in mid-2013. \nToo often, they told Bullock, the FBI’s trail went cold at the addresses of Delaware incorporation agents. Sometimes that happened when foreign law enforcement agencies sought FBI assistance chasing the money trail of a suspected criminal. Such cases, they said, frayed relations with foreign agencies, which were expected to cough up the goods whenever the FBI was hunting terrorist cash flow. \nThe two agents walked Bullock through a form and protocols used by banks in Switzerland, long one of the world’s most secretive financial hubs. If Delaware could simply meet the same minimal transparency standards as the Swiss, everyone would be happy. \nBullock told them Delaware would not tighten requirements because companies would flee to other states with lax laws, according to the agents. Bullock told them the resulting blow to the state treasury could harm his chances of winning higher office, the agents said. \n“I was pleasantly surprised that he was at least being honest,” Lormel said. \nBullock said he didn’t recall all the details of his meeting with the former FBI agents. He said he does not have future political aspirations. \n“The anonymity that is possible when using shell companies can lead to difficulties in federal investigations,” an FBI spokeswoman said. She declined to comment on the legislation. \nAN ALTERNATIVE PLAN \nThat July, NASS held its annual convention in Anchorage, Alaska. A report about shell companies, prepared in part by Bullock’s office, was circulated among the group’s shell company task force. It discussed, among other things, IRS changes that could simplify collecting ownership details. \nAfterward, other secretaries of state, including Vermont’s James Condos, entered the fray. Condos was a critical link to Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Levin’s bill would soon be pending. \nLevin’s bill “would leave companies, especially small businesses, with additional costly and confusing layers of bureaucratic red tape,” Condos wrote in an Aug. 8, 2013, letter to Leahy, days after returning from Anchorage. The bill never left the Judiciary Committee. \nCondos said that Bullock did not encourage him to write to Leahy. \nBullock and NASS say he didn’t play the lead in rallying opposition to Levin’s bill. The cause had been taken up much earlier by officials in other states, he said, and by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bar Association. NASS says secretaries of state have unanimously opposed Levin’s legislation from the start. \n“This issue was already hot and heavy when I entered the scene,” he said. \nBy 2014, some Delawareans were growing concerned about the state’s reputation as a secrecy haven. A group of state legislators began circulating a draft public letter opposing Bullock and supporting Levin’s bill. \nREBELLION AT HOME \nBullock tried to quash the letter before it went public. “I am writing to urge you to not sign on,” he wrote in an email to state Representative Paul Baumbach on July 10, 2014. To “support this kind of legislation sends the wrong message to the 1,050,000 legal entities incorporated in Delaware,” he said. \nBaumbach signed anyway. He said he has stopped following the issue. \nBullock told Reuters that he emailed the lawmakers out of concern that the registration business would simply move to other states if Delaware changed policies unilaterally. \nThirty-one of Delaware’s 62 elected state legislators signed the letter opposing Bullock and supporting Levin’s bill. “Taking action will help … ensure that individuals cannot use our state’s incorporation laws for illicit purposes,” the legislators wrote. \nThe resistance failed. In March 2014, a senior U.S. Treasury official told Lormel, the former FBI agent, that the Obama administration was conceding defeat. There was too much opposition to the bill. \nA month later, an item on the White House blog reported Obama’s support for the alternative proposal centering on IRS data. \nAsked about the change of tack, a senior administration official said: “The Obama administration wants to work with Congress to pass meaningful legislation that would require companies to know and report accurate ‘beneficial ownership’ information at the time of a company’s creation, so that the information can be made available to law enforcement.” \nLormel, the former FBI agent, said the IRS approach may yield some useful information for law enforcement, but noted that identities of real owners might still be missing. \nLEVIN AND LIMBO \nLevin retired in 2014. Other legislators took up his cause. Similar bills have struggled to gain traction. \nIn May, the U.S. Treasury unveiled a new rule that, starting in 2018, will require banks to more thoroughly vet the real owners of potential corporate customers. Levin says the Treasury’s definition of beneficial owner is loose and allows the reporting of managers instead of actual owners. \nOn July 14, Delaware’s Senator Carper introduced yet another alternative - a bill that would codify the IRS approach supported by Bullock. \nThis legislation, crafted by Bullock’s office and Delaware’s senators, would require every U.S. company to get an IRS identification number. Companies would provide “responsible party” information to the IRS that law enforcement officers could use in money-laundering and terrorism cases, according to the bill. \nThe bill also outlines a new process for federal law enforcement to obtain that information from the IRS, a step that has required a court order and often led to dead ends. \nProponents of transparency think it falls short. “These are half-measures that largely serve to deflect political opposition rather than tackle the problem,” said Mark Hays, a senior adviser at Global Witness, an anti-corruption group. \nTwo days after Carper introduced the bill, Bullock unveiled it at a NASS conference in Nashville, Tennessee. He suggested the bill would help cast secretaries of state in a more positive light after years of fighting the Levin bill. \n“I know how people portray us,” Bullock told the conclave. “I don’t want to be against things, I want to be for things.” \n(Additional reporting by Francisco Vara-Orta in Columbia, Missouri.

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Barack Obama ran for re-election, Democrats made no secret of their disdain for Mitt Romney. That was all before Donald Trump. Horrified by the prospect of Trump in the White House, Obama and his party have changed their tune about Romney. As they denounce Trump as \"unhinged\" and unfit, they're getting nostalgic about the 2012 Republican nominee they now describe as principled, competent and honorable.\nIt's a sharp reversal from four years ago. Back then, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars portraying the former Massachusetts governor as a callous, unpatriotic, pet-abusing caricature of the uber-rich.\nYet as Trump is proving, everything in politics is relative.\n\"He was in it for the right reasons,\" Stephanie Cutter, Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager, said of Romney. \"He truly believed in wanting to make this country better. We just differed significantly on how to do that.\"\nCutter said that in 2012 Democrats had ideological clashes with Romney, but didn't doubt his temperament or basic competence. She said unlike Trump, Romney didn't \"insult his way through his campaigning,\" malign minorities, or threaten to violate the Constitution or to abandon U.S. allies.\nNew York Rep. Steve Israel, one of the Democratic Party's top campaign strategists, said \"Romney was qualified, but he had the wrong ideas. Trump is unqualified, dangerous and still has the wrong ideas.\"\nAnd Obama's 2012 campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, put it this way: \"I don't think anybody would have truly expected the country to go to hell in a handbasket\" if Romney had won. \"Trump presents an entirely different level of threat,\" he said.\nRewind to 2012.\nA pro-Obama super PAC aired a TV ad indirectly alleging that Romney caused a woman's death. Democrats accused him of animal cruelty over a decades-old story about Seamus, the family dog, forced to ride rooftop on a road trip. Vice President Joe Biden told a largely black audience that Romney and his running mate were \"going to put y'all back in chains.\"\nAll the while, Obama attacked Romney's business record ruthlessly, as Democrats questioned whether Romney's use of offshore accounts made him unpatriotic. Obama's campaign even suggested Romney might have committed a felony by misrepresenting his employment status to federal regulators.\nIt's this year's great irony that the same Democratic attacks that landed hard on Romney seem to bounce right off of Trump. Where Romney had to downplay his wealth, Trump boasts of his riches, and brushes off controversies over remarks perceived as insensitive to women or minorities.\nRuss Schriefer, a top Romney adviser in 2012, said he hoped Democrats were learning that words matter, even in politics. He described a campaign equivalent of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\"\n\"Don't be surprised when your accusations against Trump are falling upon deaf ears and aren't working, when you've used them in the past against a person for whom the descriptions didn't fit,\" he said.\nBut Israel, who oversaw Democrats' efforts to win House seats that year, said he didn't think the attacks had gone too far. After all, Romney and Republicans were similarly tough on Obama, calling him a liar and a failed president.\n\"The rhetoric gets heated on both sides of the aisle in any campaign,\" Israel said.\nMany Republicans, too, have declared Trump dangerous and unsuitable for the Oval Office. Chief among them is Romney, who implored fellow Republicans during the primary not to nominate Trump and called him a phony, a fraud, a bully and a con man.\n\"I have never seen anything like it, and kudos to Romney for having the courage of his convictions when it comes to Trump,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's White House communications director during the campaign.\nThese days, even Obama seems to acknowledge that Romney wouldn't have been awful — at least not compared to Trump. Earlier this month, Obama said he would have been disappointed had he been defeated by Romney in 2012 or by Sen. John McCain in 2008, but never questioned either Republican's ability to do the job.\nA representative for Romney declined to comment on Democrats' newfound affection. But Eric Fehrnstrom, a longtime Romney adviser, called it an attempt to make GOP voters more comfortable with the idea of voting for Clinton.\n\"He knows whatever expressions of support for him now coming from Democrats are purely political,\" Fehrnstrom said. \"They're totally insincere.\"",

	      "text": "AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Black Republicans cheer Donald Trump for a newfound outreach to African-Americans, but say the GOP presidential nominee must take his message beyond arenas filled with white supporters and venture into the inner cities.\nMany rank-and-file black voters, meanwhile, dismiss the overtures as another racially charged pitch from a campaign aimed exclusively at whites, from Trump's emphasis on \"law and order\" to his withering critiques of President Barack Obama, the nation's first black chief executive. It was Trump in 2011 who fiercely challenged Obama's U.S. birth.\n\"Any minority who would vote for him is crazy, ought to have their head examined,\" said Ike Jenkins, an 81-year-old retired business owner in the predominantly black suburb of East Cleveland.\nFoluke Bennett, a 43-year-old from Philadelphia, went further, labeling the GOP standard-bearer's remarks as \"racist,\" pointing, among other things, to his referencing African-Americans as \"the blacks.\"\nTrump is scheduled to appear Wednesday in Jackson, Mississippi, an 80 percent African-American city and capital of the state with the nation's highest proportion of black residents. It is unclear whether he will address black voters directly; so far, his appeal to them has been delivered before white audiences in mostly white cities.\nMississippi is overwhelmingly Republican because of whites' loyalties, as opposed to battlegrounds such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, states Obama won twice and where the largest cities offer at least a theoretical chance for Trump to pursue marginal shifts among significant black populations.\nTrump has previously rejected high-profile speaking slots at the NAACP's annual gathering, along with events sponsored by the Urban League and the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\"He's got to take his arguments to the streets,\" said Brandon Berg, a black pastor who drove Monday from Youngstown, Ohio, to hear Trump at the University of Akron. Berg said he's an outlier: an undecided black Republican. For most African-Americans, Berg said, Trump must \"meet them where they are.\"\nTrump has scheduled an event Thursday billed as a roundtable with black and Latino leaders invited to his New York offices, and his aides say he is considering more rallies in heavily minority cities in swing states. The Washington Post first reported those plans, specifically mentioning charter schools, small businesses and churches in black and Latino communities.\nIt's a well-known electoral conundrum for Trump and Republicans: The United States population grows less white with each election cycle, so to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, the New York billionaire must attract more non-white voters or run up an advantage with white voters to a level no candidate has reached since Ronald Reagan's 1984 landslide.\nObama won 93 percent of black voters in 2012 and 95 percent in 2008, according to exit polls. This year, polls suggest Trump could fare even worse than the Republicans who lost to Obama.\nTrump has confronted his steep path in the last week, asking minorities, \"Give Trump a chance!\"\nIn Wisconsin, he declared to minorities: \"You live in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed? What the hell do you have to lose?\" He argues illegal immigration disproportionately affects economic opportunities of blacks and Hispanics.\nIn Ohio, he insisted without evidence that foreign \"war zones\" are \"safer than living in some of our inner cities.\" He pledged a Trump administration would \"get rid of the crime,\" allowing minorities to \"walk down the street without getting shot.\"\nCalvin Tucker, the lone black GOP convention delegate from Pennsylvania, says Trump's arguments resonate with him. \"We need a change agent,\" said Tucker, 64, of Philadelphia. \"He's breaking down his overall economic platform and relating it to African-Americans,\" Tucker added, extolling the GOP's emphasis on entrepreneurial pursuits.\nCertainly, each Trump pronouncement drew roaring approval from his rally audiences. Many black voters, however, hear the appeal differently.\nAs he sold Cleveland Cavaliers NBA championship swag, street vendor Steve T, 47, said the \"disrespectful\" comments represent \"the real Trump.\"\n\"Not all of us live in poverty, crime,\" he said. \"You can't get votes from people you don't even understand.\"\nIn Philadelphia, Bennett said, \"It's crazy to think that he would have the audacity to ask us what we have to lose. If anything, his comments just made the line even more clear as to why black people won't vote for him.\"\nIn East Cleveland, Jenkins and several other retirees gathered in a neighborhood restaurant echo many of Trump's arguments. James Smith, a 79-year-old former butcher, points out the window and laments \"a community that's old and poor.\" Jenkins says \"handouts keep people in slavery.\" Randall Darnell blasts an economy that traps laborers, black and white, in \"legalized slavery.\"\nBut every one plans to vote for Clinton, and nearly all said they see Trump's latest arguments aimed more at whites.\n\"He's talking about black people\" when he mentions violence in cities, Smith said, \"not to black people.\"\n___\nWhat political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

	      "text": "(President Barack Obama.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \nIt's going to be a lot easier for people to pick an Obamacare plan in 2017, if only because there will be fewer to choose from. One of the biggest drivers of increased healthcare costs is the lack of competition in some markets. This problem is acutely present for the Affordable Care Act's public insurance exchanges, according to a new study by Avalere Health.\nAccording to the healthcare consulting firm, the high-profile exits of large insurers such as Aetna , United Healthcare , and Humana have eliminated a significant amount of competition within the exchange market.\n\"Nearly 36 percent of exchange market rating regions may have only one participating insurance carrier offering plans for the 2017 plan year and there may be some sub-region counties where no plans are available,\" Avalere President Dan Mendelson wrote in a post on the study.\n\"Nearly 55 percent of exchange market rating regions may have two or fewer carriers.\"\nScreen Shot 2016 08 24 at 7.40.06 AM More (Avalere Health) \n\nAvalere went through each of the coverage regions (the size of which can vary by state) and analyzed the current offerings by health insurers in 2016 and the so-far announced offerings for 2017.\nThe firm found that there are seven states — Alaska, Alabama, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming — in which every coverage region has only one participating insurer. This essentially gives the insurer a monopoly and forces patients in that region to accept the premium that company offers.\nCompetition in the health insurance market has been a focus of government regulators for some time. One of the main reasons cited by the Department of Justice for blocking the mergers of Anthem and Cigna as well as Aetna and Humana was concern about decreased competition.\nThis analysis only takes into account the announced moves from the three companies that plan to roll back their offerings, so there is a chance some insurers may step into the underserved markets.\nAs it stands now, however, it appears one of the largest drivers of high healthcare costs for the Affordable Care Act's public exchanges is only getting worse.\nNOW WATCH: This animated map shows the most probable path to a Trump victory \n\nMore From Business Insider \n\nFor the first time, a county in America has lost all of its Obamacare insurers \nObamacare has gone from the president's greatest achievement to a 'slow-motion death spiral' \nNow we know the real reason Aetna bailed on Obamacare",

	      "text": "Is Barack Obama the best gun salesman in history? The governor of Illinois just signed a new gun control law to combat the sale of firearms in the bullet-ridden city of Chicago. Gov. Bruce Rauner approved a law on Tuesday that imposes a stiff penalty on anyone without a gun-owner identification card who brings a gun into the state of Illinois to sell. \nThat crime is now a felony that carries a prison sentence of four to 20 years, or up to 30 years for repeat offenders, according to a spokeswoman for Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno, one of the bill's sponsors. \nBefore this new law was passed, gun owners caught for the first time without the proper ID were charged with a misdemeanor and got less than a year. Repeat offenders would get up to 5 years. \nThe governor and House Republican Leader Jim Durkin made it clear that the law is aimed at reducing crime in Chicago . Durkin said that 425 people have been murdered with guns in Chicago so far this year, and another 2,320 have been wounded. The guns in about 60% of those crimes were purchased out of state, he said. \nChicago gun violence has been particularly bad this year, with thousands shot and more than 400 killed. The law is meant to cut down on straw purchasers who buy guns in states with loose laws and drive them into cities with tough gun control laws, like Chicago and New York, for resale. This flow of guns is known as the Iron Pipeline . \nThe states surrounding New York City have relatively restrictive gun laws, and they're getting tougher all the time. Now that Virginia and Maryland have strengthened their laws, New York City gun runners drive all the way down I-95 to gun-friendly Georgia and Florida or up to Maine to buy firearms for resale in the city. \nRelated: How the Iron Pipeline brings guns into cities with tough gun laws \nBut Chicago has a much shorter Iron Pipeline. Illinois has relatively restrictive gun laws but Indiana does not, and Chicago happens to be right on the Indiana border. So straw buyers don't have to travel far to bring illegal guns to the Windy City. \nProsecutors in Chicago and New York say gangs get their guns from straw buyers. But gun advocates like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the gun industry, downplay the problem of straw buyers. \n 30 PM ET",

Hide Caption 40 of 40 Story highlights Latest revelations make ethical issues surrounding the Clinton Foundation appear even more serious, writes Buck Sexton An AP study found many of those who met with Clinton were donors; emails suggest some got special access, he writes Buck Sexton is a political commentator for CNN and host of \"The Buck Sexton Show\" on TheBlaze . He was previously a CIA counterterrorism analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) There's the appearance of impropriety, and then there's the outright selling of government favors. Hillary Clinton's ties to the Clinton Foundation while secretary of state have always appeared dubious and unethical. Now, with the revelations by The Associated Press that suggest donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access, Clinton's defenders will have to address allegations that Madame Secretary was, in effect, selling her official time to the highest bidders. With a quick glance at the numbers, any honest observer can recognize the depth and breadth of Clinton's pay to play scheme. Of the 154 people from private interests who met with or spoke on the phone with Clinton, 85 were also donors to her foundation . Their contributions totaled around $156 million. And this figure is entirely separate from the 16 foreign governments that passed along $170 million to the Clinton charity, all of whom likely expected favorable treatment for their interests from our nation's chief diplomat. This not only looks improper, but under different political circumstances, and perhaps a different attorney general, a special prosecutor would be appointed to investigate. That the Obama administration set up guidelines for Clinton while she was secretary of state in no way relieves her of her obligations to uphold her oath of office, nor would any handshake agreement with the White House absolve her of federal laws concerning corruption. There is simply no excuse for her creating the appearance that access to one of the most important positions in the United States government was for sale. Trump wasted tough attack on Clinton (Opinion) The pro-Clinton chorus will no doubt claim that, as with the email server scandal, no criminal charges have been filed in regard to the Clinton Foundation, and so there is nothing to see here. But such a defense is both premature, and even if true, still undermines their preferred candidate. Media should stop indulging Trump pivot talk (Opinion) We are still learning more about Clinton's dealings with the foundation as emails continue to trickle out (including 15,000 just recently discovered), under court order, from the State Department. And even if no charges are ever brought, the Clinton campaign has reached an ignominious low when Clinton has to breathe a sigh of relief not once but twice a summer as the hand of the Justice Department passes over her without indictment. \"I'm not a crook\" is hardly an inspiring slogan for the Clinton faithful. Read More There are questions to which Americans must demand answers from the Clinton campaign, should she ever decide to descend from on high for a real press conference. If Clinton wasn't selling access to her office as secretary of state, why did so many of the people seeking to meet with her also donate to the foundation? Meeting with a sitting secretary of state is not a trip to Disney World. It's the sort of thing that a person arranges when there is business to discuss, and it seems that many of the Clinton donors wanted help from the secretary. If those meetings were scheduled, and favorable treatment handed out, because of donations to her foundation, Clinton violated the trust of the American people, and is guilty of corruption. There is another ethical level on which both Hillary and Bill Clinton have fallen far short: the conduct of the foundation itself. The primary focus of a charitable organization should be charity with a clear mission in mind. When it comes to the motive behind it, the Clinton Foundation is more family corporation and public relations firm than altruistic venture. Clinton's emails and the Washington insider game (opinion) Nobody has to wonder what the Red Cross, Salvation Army or St Jude's Hospital do with donations. On the other hand, the Clinton Global Initiative has as its mission statement to \"create and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges.\" This broad and meaningless pablum should raise more than a few eyebrows. If the Clintons were so interested in helping the world, why not simply raise money for the already established charities that exist to help those in need? We know the answer. The Clinton Foundation is a club for the connected and the powerful, posing as saviors of mankind. In reality, it's mostly about private jet travel to fancy conferences for the wealthy and well-connected. And most importantly, Clinton offered donors the facade of selflessness as they bought access to high government office. We now know assorted power brokers, shady international businessmen and autocratic regimes eagerly played along with the ruse. The Clintons, not content merely to make lying a political art form, have gone a step further. In their insatiable appetite for power and money, they have polluted charitable giving itself. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Now, thanks to the woman who wishes to be the most powerful politician in the world, consideration for the poor and unfortunate has been commoditized for the benefit of self-indulgent plutocrats who want a tax write-off. That many Americans, and certainly a majority of Clinton supporters, don't seem to care enough to reject Clinton as our next commander in chief is an indictment of their expectations for character and dignity in an elected official. Any honest observer has to ask whether the truth about Clinton's corporate fiefdom, cynically masked with the trappings of a charity, should sink her presidential ambitions. That so many Americans seem willing to overlook her serial ethical failings is among the most depressing truths of an already dispiriting election season.",

	      "text": "Debate Commission faces new challenge in selecting moderators by Dylan Byers @CNNMoney August 24, 2016: 5:43 PM ET Trump camp accuses Dems of rigging debate dates The first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is in just over a month, and yet neither candidate knows who the moderator will be. \nThey won't know until after Labor Day, sources with knowledge of the matter told CNNMoney. The Commission on Presidential Debates had planned to announce moderators in late August, but it now intends to wait until after September 5, the sources said. \nThe delay is due in part to an unprecedented challenge the bipartisan Commission faces in selecting individuals who are immune (or at least as immune as possible) to accusations of bias. While that is always a concern for the Commission, the sources said it is more challenging than ever this time around due to one factor: Donald Trump. \nRelated: Donald Trump and RNC attack presidential debate schedule \nThe last thing the Commission wants is for the moderator to become part of the story about a debate. Yet Trump's aggressive attacks on the media and complaints about unfair treatment have effectively guaranteed that the moderators will come under scrutiny from conservatives. \nThis has made the Commission even more cautious than usual in researching potential moderators, sources said. The Commission fears that Trump would use even the slightest whiff of a pro-Clinton bias to attack a moderator and undermine his or her credibility. \nTheir efforts are complicated by the fact that Clinton has been a public figure for 30 years and has developed unique relationships with certain journalists. \nFor example: One source said that Charlie Rose was unlikely to be selected because a 2012 Wall Street Journal report placed him and the Clintons in a \"close group\" of celebrities and political figures who spent a Christmas vacation at Oscar De La Renta's house in the Dominican Republic. \nThe appearance of any friendship between candidate and moderator is likely to cause a stir, as it did last cycle when The Daily Caller reported that President Barack Obama had been a guest at the 1991 wedding of ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz, the moderator of the vice presidential debate. (The groom had worked with Obama on the Harvard Law Review.) ABC called the controversy \"absurd,\" but it nevertheless served as a distraction. \nThe Commission is also likely to pass over any television personality who has had a dust-up with either candidate. So while Fox News host Megyn Kelly has been one of the most prominent media personalities in the 2016 cycle because of her public spat with Trump , she will almost certainly not be invited to moderate a debate for exactly that reason. \nInstead, the Commission is looking at candidates who -- in addition to being qualified and capable of moderating a debate -- have no ties to Clinton or Trump, no record of controversy with either candidate, and a reputation for being fair and evenhanded. \nHere, the Commission is handicapped by the absence of Jim Lehrer and Bob Schieffer, two elder statesmen of political journalism whom the Commission frequently relied upon to serve as moderators. Both men retired from moderating debates after the 2012 cycle and joined the Commission's board of directors, though Schieffer it left earlier this year in order to return to CBS News as an occasional contributor. \nWhile both men had mixed reviews for their performances as moderators, Lehrer and Schieffer were veterans in their field and largely trusted by the general public. They also understood that the role of the moderator was to preside over a debate between the candidates, not to become a part of it. As Schieffer told CNNMoney, \"nobody comes to the baseball game to see the umpires. They come to see the players.\" \nWhile Schieffer declined to speculate on who the Commission might select, he seemed optimistic that it would make the right choices. \"There are some really good people out there,\" he said, \"and I have real confidence in the Commission.\" CNNMoney (Los Angeles) First published August 24, 2016: 5:43 PM ET ",

JUST WATCHED Why should Sanders' supporters vote for Jill Stein? 02:28 Story highlights Our Revolution will function as a 501(c)(4), a tax-exempt non-profit The group will focus on involving new progressives into politics Washington (CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to fill in his supporters on his next moves Wednesday night during a livestream address to his supporters. The address, in which Sanders will discuss \" Our Revolution ,\" a group that intends to further his progressive political movement, marks his first remarks to supporters since his speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, which served as the official end to his presidential campaign. Sanders will beam onto computer screens from a flash studio in Vermont, the same location where he gave his \"Where We Go From Here\" speech at the end of June after meeting with President Barack Obama and then his primary challenger, Hillary Clinton. Our Revolution will function as a 501(c)(4), a tax-exempt non-profit. Sanders sent his first fundraising email for the new organization to supporters at the beginning of the month. 2016 candidate matchmaker Read More \"We are building a new organization called Our Revolution. Our goal will be the same as in our campaign: we must work to transform American society by making our political and economic systems work for all of us, not just the 1 percent,\" he wrote on August 3. Our Revolution will focus on involving new progressives into politics, even as local as school board and city councils. It's a message Sanders fervently preached as his campaign was ending. \"All of you know that election days come and go but what is much more important is that political and social revolutions continue,\" he said in a rambunctious town hall in New York City at the end of June. Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college map The organization's first mission has been fundraising for the primary opponent of former Democratic National Committee chief -- and Sanders nemesis -- Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Tim Canova. Our Revolution will be lead by Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, who will function as the president of the organization. Sanders' former bodyman, Shannon Jackson, will work as the executive director. What to expect from Sanders Weaver said the senator will focus on talking to Bernie 2016 supporters and discussing familiar issues from the campaign trail. He'll also explain the goals of Our Revolution to Bernie supporters who were bitter by the end of his presidential campaign. Taste test 2016: Clinton's cookies vs. Trump's cookies The slow end of the Sanders campaign was viewed by some in the campaign as a good way to ease die-hard fans into the idea of Clinton as the Democratic nominee. Weaver, for his part, is not concerned that Bernie supporters might be losing interest or steam now that Sanders is no longer in the race. \"I think that Bernie Sanders' supporters were strongly motivated by that desire to see progressive change. I'm confident they will want to remain involved and I'm very confident that we will be able to retain the level of excitement,\" he told CNN. Despite positive spin from Weaver, the organization itself is already experiencing some turmoil. Buzzfeed first reported that eight members of the organization recently quit . Weaver confirmed to CNN that seven had left, saying one person thought they were going to leave but decided to stay. Weaver said he was not sure if Sanders would mention Clinton and his desire to see Donald Trump defeated. Sanders has voiced several full endorsements of Clinton in recent weeks. Sections ",

	      "text": "18:09 ET (22:09 GMT) 24 agosto, 2016 Lo más importante \nLa Fundación Clinton está bajo ataque por parte de Donald Trump y de quienes lo apoyan \nBill Clinton anunció que si Hillary Clinton gana la presidencia, dejará de recibir donaciones del exterior \nWASHINGTON (CNN) - La Fundación Clinton está bajo un creciente escrutinio mientras los republicanos la acusan de ser una institución corrupta y opaca. \nEl candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump pidió un fiscal especial para investigar la fundación y acusó a su oponente demócrata Hillary Clinton de estar involucrada en \"criminalidad\" debido a las conexiones entre los donantes de la organización familiar y sus acciones como secretaria de Estado. Este martes, Trump se refirió a un reporte de The Associated Press sobre el alto número de contribuyentes de la fundación que Clinton recibió en reuniones. \nLa compleja y extensa estructura de la fundación, su historia de donaciones desde el exterior y su atractivo como linea de ataque de los republicanos significa que muy probablemente seguirá en el centro de atención. \n¿Qué es la Fundación Clinton? \nBill Clinton abrió la organización de caridad pública luego de que dejó la presidencia en 2001, con la idea de unir a gobiernos, negocios y grupos sociales para enfrentar grandes problemas. Era una especie de nueva idea en ese entonces. El lunes, Clinton escribió que la fundación busca \"crear oportunidades y resolver los problemas más rápido, mejor, y a menor costo para que más gente se empodere para construir mejores futuros para ellos, sus familias y sus comunidades\". \nPero, ¿qué es esto? \nLa fundación está conformada por 11 grupos no gubernamentales que trabajan en cuatro grandes asuntos: salud global y bienestar, cambio climático, desarrollo económico y el mejorar las oportunidades de mujeres y niñas. \n¿Cómo lo hace? \nEs lo que los filántropos llaman una fundación operativa, lo que significa que no da mucho dinero a grupos externos para lograr sus misiones. En 2014, la fundación dio menos del 3% de sus ingresos a otras organizaciones. A cambio, la fundación realiza su propio trabajo, con empleados y socios en todo el mundo. \n¿Qué tipo de trabajo? \nLa salud es un gran enfoque. En más de 70 países, de acuerdo con la fundación, ayuda a 11,5 millones de personas, incluyendo 800.000 niños, con VIH/sida para que tengan acceso a medicamentos a un costo 90% menor, lo que representa a más de la mitad de los adultos y tres cuartas partes de los niños que reciben tratamiento en el mundo en la actualidad. \nPero también realiza todo tipo de trabajo. Por ejemplo, ayuda a granjeros en el este de África a tener mejores semillas y fertilizantes. Apoyó a la reconstrucción de Nepal luego del sismo de 2015 y ha conectado a más de 500.000 latinoamericanos con capacitación para el trabajo y oportunidades empresariales. \nBien, ¿es entonces solo un grupo internacional benéfico? \nSi. Y no. La Fundación Clinton realiza mucho trabajo en Estados Unidos también. Algunos ejemplos: Tiene un programa escolar que opera en cada estado, que involucra a más de 31.000 escuelas y 18 millones de estudiantes según sus cifras. El programa ayuda a mejorar la educación física, la nutrición infantil, la educación de salud y los programas de bienestar del personal. También trabajan para combatir las adicciones a medicamentos bajo prescripción. La fundación quiere reducir a la mitad el número de sobredosis por opioides, ya que ahora mismo esas sobredosis matan a más estadounidenses que los accidentes de auto. \n¿Es lo mismo la fundación y la Iniciativa Global Clinton? \nLa Iniciativa Global Clinton es parte de la Fundación. Bill Clinton comenzó la iniciativa en 2005. En contraste con otras partes de la organización, no financia o maneja proyectos ni involucra ningún tipo de dinero. A cambio, es como el OKCupid de la caridad mundial, uniendo a financiadores con buenas causas. Esto lo hacen en eventos todo el año, incluyendo durante un gran evento anual en Nueva York cada septiembre. \nEntonces, ¿es todo un montón de conexiones sobre caridad? \nDesde la primera reunión anual en 2005, la iniciativa ha ayudado a realizar más de 3.500 compromisos entre financiadores y proyectos. En términos de la vida real, eso significa que han sido tocadas las vidas de más de 430 millones de personas en más de 180 países. \nMás de 46 millones de niños tienen acceso a una mejor educación, según calcula la fundación. La Iniciativa Global Clinton ha reunido más de 313 millones de dólares para investigar y desarrollar nuevas vacunas, medicinas y diagnósticos. Y también a ayudado a más de 27 millones de personas a tener un mejor acceso a agua limpia y sanidad. \nSi se está haciendo todo bien entonces, ¿por qué la sospecha? \nDebido a preocupaciones sobre transparencia y especialmente, desde que Hillary Clinton se volvió secretaria de Estado, preocupaciones sobre que algunos donantes, especialmente gobiernos extranjeros, pudieron estar intentando comprar influencia. \nLa agencia AP reportó el martes que durante su tiempo como secretaria, más de la mitad de las reuniones de Clinton con gente fuera del gobierno fueron con donantes de la Fundación Clinton. Estas incluyen a ejecutivos de Estee Lauder -que estaba trabajando con el Departamento de Estado en un proyecto sobre violencia de género en Sudáfrica- y con el fundador de un banco sin fines de lucro que pedía ayuda porque su gobierno en Bangladesh lo estaba presionando para que renunciara. \n¿Qué ha dicho el Departamento de Estado sobre eso? \nMark Toner, vocero adjunto, dijo en un comunicado este martes que \"individuos, incluyendo los que donaron a campañas políticas, organizaciones sin fines de lucro o fundaciones, incluyendo la Fundación Clinton, pudieron tener contacto o reuniones con funcionarios de la administración. Un gran rango de individuos y organizaciones externas contactan al Departamento de Estado. Pedidos de reuniones, recomendaciones y propuestas llegan al departamento a través de una variedad de canales tanto formales como informales\". \n¿En qué consiste el problema con la transparencia? \nDe quién está obteniendo dinero la fundación, básicamente. Cuando Clinton tomó el cargo de secretaria de Estado en 2008, ella prometió al presidente Barack Obama que la fundación publicaría la lista de sus todos sus donantes año con año. Y... eso no ocurrió. \nReuters descubrió que desde 2010 hasta 2013, el área encargada de asuntos de salud de la fundación no dio a conocer la lista completa de sus donantes, dejando fuera a países como Suiza o metiendo a individuos en un solo grupo. La fundación no dijo al Departamento de Estado que países como Australia y el Reino Unido duplicaron o triplicaron sus donaciones entre 2009 y 2012, cuando Clinton era secretaria de Estado. \n¿Qué han dicho los oponentes de Clinton? \nNo es sorpresa que Trump haya tocado el tema para atacar a Clinton. Esta semana, en Akron, Ohio, realizó una serie de acusaciones sin ofrecer pruebas, al decir: \"ningún asunto ilustra mejor qué tan corrupta es mi oponente como sus escándalos de pagos por favores como secretaria de Estado\". \nÉl pidió un fiscal especial para investigar a la fundación. \n¿Solo los republicanos han acusado a la fundación? \nNo. Ha habido mucha cobertura en medios sobre los acuerdos mientras Clinton estaba en Departamento de Estado. Pero hasta ahora, no hay pruebas concluyentes. The Wall Street Journal ha reportado que la fundación benefició a los amigos de Bill Clinton. Y Fox News reportó sobre que el Departamento de Estado consideró comprar un terreno en Nigeria en marzo de 2013 a dos hermanos de nacionalidad nigeriana y libanesa que fueron grandes donantes de la Fundación Clinton. Clinton dejó el Departamento de Estado el 1 de febrero de 2013 y la compra nunca se realizó. \n¿Algún crítico entre los demócratas? \nEn una entrevista en junio con CNN durante las primarias, el senador Bernie Sanders dijo que donantes de la fundación como Arabia Saudita crearon la apariencia de un conflicto de interés. \"¿Tengo un problema cuando una secretaria de Estado en funciones recolecta millones de dólares de gobiernos extranjeros... dictaduras?\", preguntó Sanders. \"¿Tengo un problema con eso? Si\". \n¿Es extraño que la Fundación Clinton tenga donantes extranjeros? \nSon comunes las donaciones del extranjero a fundaciones y caridades de Estados Unidos. \n\"Al igual que otras organizaciones sin fines de lucro, la Fundación Clinton busca dinero de las fundaciones que lo tienen, como Gates y Rockefeller, así como de gobiernos extranjeros, la mayoría de los cuales también donan a otras organizaciones sin fines de lucro\", según David Callahan, editor en jefe de Inside Philanthropy. \n¿Que dicen los Clinton en respuesta a esas acusaciones? \nLa fundación siempre ha rechazado las acusaciones de \"pagos por favores\" y ha ofrecido varias razones por las cuales no ha dado a conocer la lista de sus donantes. Bill Clinton dijo que el reporte del Wall Street Journal no era correcto. Y Craig Minassian, vocero de la fundación, ha dicho que hay amigos de Clinton involucrados en los compromisos de la iniciativa porque a ellos también les importa realizar un impacto positivo. \n¿Qué pasará si Clinton gana la presidencia? \n\"No ha sido fácil el proceso para determinar el futuro de la Fundación Clinton si Hillary Clinton gana la presidencia\", escribió Bill Clinton. \"Es una situación sin precedentes, por lo que no hay un manual que seguir\". \nSin embargo, dijo que se tomarán algunos pasos si su esposa gana. Solo aceptará donaciones de residentes legales y ciudadanos estadounidenses y de fundaciones independientes con sede en Estados Unidos. Bill Clinton renunciará de la junta directiva y dejará de recolectar fondos. \nDebido a que mucho del trabajo internacional está financiado parcialmente por programas de ayuda de gobiernos extranjeros, ellos tendrán que mover esos programas a otras organizaciones que puedan continuarlos. Además, según Clinton, este septiembre se realizará la última reunión anual de la Iniciativa Global Clinton. Notas relacionadas ",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration said Wednesday it paid $1.3 billion in interest to Iran in January to resolve a decades-old dispute over an undelivered military sale, two days after allowing $400 million in cash to fly to Tehran.\nState Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau says the U.S. couldn't say more about the Jan. 19 payments because of diplomatic sensitivities. They involved 13 separate payments of $99,999,999.99 and final payment of about $10 million. There was no explanation for the Treasury Department keeping the individual transactions under $100 million.\nThe money settles a dispute over a $400 million payment made in the 1970s by the U.S.-backed shah's government for military equipment. The equipment was never delivered because of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the shah and ended diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iran.\nOn Jan. 17, the administration paid Iran the account's $400 million principal in pallets of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency, raising questions about the unusual payment. The $1.3 billion covers what Iran and the U.S. agreed would be the interest on the $400 million over the decades.\nThe deal has faced increased scrutiny since the administration's acknowledgment this month that it used the money as leverage to ensure the release of four American prisoners.\nRepublican critics accuse the administration of paying a \"ransom.\"\nPresident Barack Obama and other officials deny such claims, though they've struggled to explain why the U.S. paid in cash. Obama said it was because the United States and Iran didn't have a banking relationship after years of nuclear-related sanctions, but that wouldn't rule out using intermediary banks that maintain relationship with both.\nBriefing reporters last week, a senior U.S. official involved in the negotiations said the interest payments were made to Iran in a \"fairly above-board way,\" using a foreign central bank. But the official, who wasn't authorized to be Quote: d by name and demanded anonymity, wouldn't say if the interest was delivered to Iran in physical cash, as with the $400 million principal, or via a more regular banking mechanism.\nThe money came from a little-known fund administered by the Treasury Department for settling litigation claims. The so-called Judgment Fund is taxpayer money Congress has permanently approved in the event it's needed, allowing the president to bypass direct congressional approval to make a settlement. The U.S. previously paid out $278 million in Iran-related claims by using the fund in 1991.",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Barack Obama ran for re-election, Democrats made no secret of their disdain for Mitt Romney. That was all before Donald Trump.\nHorrified by the prospect of Trump in the White House, Obama and his party have changed their tune about Romney. As they denounce Trump as “unhinged” and unfit, they’re getting nostalgic about the 2012 Republican nominee they now describe as principled, competent and honorable.\nIt’s a sharp reversal from four years ago. Back then, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars portraying the former Massachusetts governor as a callous, unpatriotic, pet-abusing caricature of the uber-rich.\nYet as Trump is proving, everything in politics is relative.\n“He was in it for the right reasons,” Stephanie Cutter, Obama’s 2012 deputy campaign manager, said of Romney. “He truly believed in wanting to make this country better. We just differed significantly on how to do that.”\nCutter said that in 2012 Democrats had ideological clashes with Romney, but didn’t doubt his temperament or basic competence. She said unlike Trump, Romney didn’t “insult his way through his campaigning,” malign minorities, or threaten to violate the Constitution or to abandon U.S. allies.\nNew York Rep. Steve Israel, one of the Democratic Party’s top campaign strategists, said “Romney was qualified, but he had the wrong ideas. Trump is unqualified, dangerous and still has the wrong ideas.”\nAnd Obama’s 2012 campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, put it this way: “I don’t think anybody would have truly expected the country to go to hell in a handbasket” if Romney had won. “Trump presents an entirely different level of threat,” he said.\nRewind to 2012.\nA pro-Obama super PAC aired a TV ad indirectly alleging that Romney caused a woman’s death. Democrats accused him of animal cruelty over a decades-old story about Seamus, the family dog, forced to ride rooftop on a road trip. Vice President Joe Biden told a largely black audience that Romney and his running mate were “going to put y'all back in chains.”\nAll the while, Obama attacked Romney’s business record ruthlessly, as Democrats questioned whether Romney’s use of offshore accounts made him unpatriotic. Obama’s campaign even suggested Romney might have committed a felony by misrepresenting his employment status to federal regulators.\nIt’s this year’s great irony that the same Democratic attacks that landed hard on Romney seem to bounce right off of Trump. Where Romney had to downplay his wealth, Trump boasts of his riches, and brushes off controversies over remarks perceived as insensitive to women or minorities.\nRuss Schriefer, a top Romney adviser in 2012, said he hoped Democrats were learning that words matter, even in politics. He described a campaign equivalent of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.”\n“Don’t be surprised when your accusations against Trump are falling upon deaf ears and aren’t working, when you’ve used them in the past against a person for whom the descriptions didn’t fit,” he said.\nBut Israel, who oversaw Democrats’ efforts to win House seats that year, said he didn’t think the attacks had gone too far. After all, Romney and Republicans were similarly tough on Obama, calling him a liar and a failed president.\n“The rhetoric gets heated on both sides of the aisle in any campaign,” Israel said.\nMany Republicans, too, have declared Trump dangerous and unsuitable for the Oval Office. Chief among them is Romney, who implored fellow Republicans during the primary not to nominate Trump and called him a phony, a fraud, a bully and a con man.\n“I have never seen anything like it, and kudos to Romney for having the courage of his convictions when it comes to Trump,” said Dan Pfeiffer, Obama’s White House communications director during the campaign.\nThese days, even Obama seems to acknowledge that Romney wouldn’t have been awful — at least not compared to Trump. Earlier this month, Obama said he would have been disappointed had he been defeated by Romney in 2012 or by Sen. John McCain in 2008, but never questioned either Republican’s ability to do the job.\nA representative for Romney declined to comment on Democrats’ newfound affection. But Eric Fehrnstrom, a longtime Romney adviser, called it an attempt to make GOP voters more comfortable with the idea of voting for Clinton.\n“He knows whatever expressions of support for him now coming from Democrats are purely political,” Fehrnstrom said. “They’re totally insincere.”\nRELATED VIDEO:",

Hillary Clinton arrives Thursday to campaign in this battleground state that Barack Obama easily carried twice as both public and internal campaign polls show a dead heat here. Trump's resilience in Nevada is surprising considering Clinton's many advantages here: her access to the strong organizational muscle of labor, a growing Latino population that has chafed at Trump's tone on immigration, and Obama's successes, which laid the groundwork for her run. There are a series of complex factors at play in the Silver State. Though the economy has improved, many voters here say they still feel the sting of the recession. This is also a state that strongly values Second Amendment rights, and both Republicans and conservative Democrats see Clinton as too liberal on that issue. Nevada's anti-government bent and libertarian streak make it a good fit for Trump, who won a resounding victory in the caucuses here. Read More In interviews this week, voters were generally more forgiving of Trump's controversial remarks than in other states -- insistent that the most important thing about his candidacy is that he can bring change (even if they aren't quite sure what that change will be). Dan Lingle, a welder from the Reno area, said the economy is so bad that he had to go back to work for himself. \"I'm 61 and white -- so things haven't been good for me at all,\" he said. \"A sense of entitlement is the only reason I think anybody would be voting for Hillary Clinton,\" Lingle said. \"We've got to get back to a country that's working. Even though he's a loose cannon, I think Trump would be better for Americans and jobs.... People are just fed up with the status quo. Anybody voting for Hillary right now is just voting for Obama again.... The world is ready for a woman president but not that one.\" So far Clinton -- and Trump, with his unforced errors -- have managed to make the election a referendum on Trump. But the coolness with which voters have greeted her in Nevada illustrate her weaknesses as a candidate. If Trump becomes a more disciplined candidate in the coming weeks, and begins to strike a more moderate tone -- as he did on immigration in an interview with Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday night -- Clinton could be facing an uphill climb in Nevada and other states. Democrats and some independent voters here say they are frightened by Trump's unpredictability. But some of that fear and uncertainty about Trump has been negated by the fact that Clinton is also widely distrusted. Larry McDaniel, a Democrat from Golden Valley, said he is voting for Trump because he doesn't trust the Clintons or \"the way they've moved money around\" from donors to their foundation. He disagreed with Trump's call for a Muslim travel ban and Trump's characterizations of undocumented immigrants, who he described as some of \"the most wonderful and trustworthy people I've known in my life.\" But Trump, McDaniel said, \"talks our language.\" \"Do I think all the people who are coming over (the border) are murderers and rapists? No, I don't. But do I think we need to protect our borders in a more reasonable manner? Yeah, I do,\" said McDaniel, a 69-year-old general contractor. \"He's not afraid of saying something that's not politically correct.\" \"Do I think he's his own worst enemy at times? Yeah, I really do,\" McDaniel continued. \"It's like 'Don't put your foot in your mouth again -- I'm trying to believe in you, but golly.\" Clinton's struggles with Democrats For all of Trump's flaws as a candidate, Clinton is struggling with trust issues even among women who are voting for her. \"I feel like I'm voting against someone as opposed to for someone,\" said Treva J. Hearne, 69-year-old attorney from Reno who was eating breakfast at the popular local diner known as Two Chicks. When Obama ran for president, Hearne was a precinct committeeman: \"I was out there every day working. I have done nothing (this cycle). Nothing.\" \"We're talking about the first woman president,\" said Hearne. \"Don't we want her to be a Michelle Obama-type? Somebody who rises above the fray. Somebody who is not so involved in politics that you feel as though they've been dirtied?\" \"This is the feeling you walk away with: that she was willing to do whatever it took to get where she is today,\" Hearne said. \"And I suppose, just being an old hippie, I really have a problem with that.\" Tom Malen, a 65-year-old Democrat from Reno, said he'll vote for Clinton even though he's not excited about either candidate. \"I think she would be stronger all the way around. She's a very smart lady. Donald Trump is too used to being in charge. He's too used to, 'My way.' This is the way it's going to be,\" Malen said. \"She knows politics. Donald only knows he's the board chairman and it's going to be 'My way.' Nah, not when you hit Congress pal. He only has X amount of power. He's not a king,\" Malen added. Democrats have won here in past election cycles by painting their opponents as too extreme on social issues --- making inroads with more libertarian leaning voters. It has been harder to paint Trump with that brush, because his position on abortion has evolved dramatically over the decades and he is viewed as more flexible on gay rights issues than other Republicans. Getting new Trump voters to the polls Still, the key to winning this state will be turnout and boosting voter registration, which has been a huge focus of both sides in recent years. George W. Bush narrowly won Nevada in 2000 and 2004 on the strength of his ground game and his unique appeal to the burgeoning population of Latino voters. But to make up for high Republican turnout here, Democrats have heavily ramped up their voter registration efforts, helping to lay the ground work for Obama's 12-point win over John McCain in 2008 and his nearly 7-point win over Mitt Romney in 2012. In part because of her fierce primary season battle against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton has a far more organized effort here than Trump -- one that existed long before the Nevada caucuses. As in other states, Trump is leaning heavily on the Republican National Committee to help him contact and persuade voters. Strategists here, however, note that because his outsider message resonated here, Trump blew away expectations for the Republican caucuses, winning in a landslide by drawing out many new GOP voters. Some 75,000 Republicans turned out for the caucuses, compared with just 33,000 when Mitt Romney ran in 2012. Because Trump voters and potential volunteers are new to the process, the Republican National Committee has increased the number of new volunteer trainings that they are conducting in the state to reinforce the importance of phone-banking, door-knocking and sustained voter contact -- underscoring the fact that merely showing up at Trump rallies will not help him win the state. A recent Suffolk University poll showing Clinton up 44% to 42% in Nevada suggests some geographic hurdles for Clinton, which is why her surrogates -- including Tim Kaine and Bill Clinton -- have been so visible here. In the Democratic stronghold of Clark County surrounding Las Vegas -- where Democrats can rely on the culinary workers and other labor unions to turn out voters in huge numbers -- Clinton is leading Trump by 13 points. Though Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot here, third party candidates like Libertarian Gary Johnson are siphoning some of the support away from the two major candidates. And in an even more intriguing sign of how polarizing both Clinton and Trump are among the electorate, 3% of respondents in Clark County said they would choose Nevada's \"none-of-these-candidates\" option on their ballot. Seven percent of voters were still undecided. In Washoe County, the state's bellwether, Trump led Clinton by three points in the Suffolk poll, making it a dead heat. That is a key reason why Clinton is campaigning in Reno on Thursday; and Trump will attend a local party fundraiser in Lake Tahoe on Friday night. Gun politics helping Trump Not surprisingly, Trump has a wide lead in the sparsely populated rural counties where even conservative Democrats are concerned that Clinton has moved too far to the left on gun rights. David Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, noted that one interesting finding in the university's poll was that the gender gap was less pronounced in Nevada than in other battleground states. He believes that is because Clinton is still struggling with gun owners, who make up 40% of likely voters in Nevada according to Suffolk's poll. In gun-owning households, Trump led among men 59% to 28% and led among women 56% to 33%, Paleologos said. In non-gun-owning households, the survey showed the reverse: Clinton led among men 59% to 29% and beat Trump among women 55% to 26%. \"To me, that's the key,\" Paleologos said. \"The places where the gender gap is neutralized is in gun ownership versus the non-gun ownership households.\" One of the initiatives on the ballot this year in Nevada would require any unlicensed person who wants to sell or transfer a firearm to another person to do the transfer through a gun dealer, who could conduct a background check on the potential buyer. At the moment, the measure has majority support, but the NRA is lobbying heavily against it -- a crosscurrent that could help bring out more pro-Trump voters. Thursday, Clinton is expected to attack Trump's \"alt-right\" message and paint him as out of step with Nevada voters, but she has yet to demonstrate that she has found her own message that resonates with voters here.

	      "text": "Story highlights Clinton and Trump are tied in Nevada, a state Obama won twice Nevada's anti-government bent and libertarian streak make it a good fit for Trump Reno, Nevada (CNN) Donald Trump continues to trail in key swing states, but that has not been the case in Nevada, a state that helped him clinch the Republican nomination.\nHillary Clinton arrives Thursday to campaign in this battleground state that Barack Obama easily carried twice as both public and internal campaign polls show a dead heat here. Trump's resilience in Nevada is surprising considering Clinton's many advantages here: her access to the strong organizational muscle of labor, a growing Latino population that has chafed at Trump's tone on immigration, and Obama's successes, which laid the groundwork for her run. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up There are a series of complex factors at play in the Silver State. Though the economy has improved, many voters here say they still feel the sting of the recession. This is also a state that strongly values Second Amendment rights, and both Republicans and conservative Democrats see Clinton as too liberal on that issue. Read More Nevada's anti-government bent and libertarian streak make it a good fit for Trump, who won a resounding victory in the caucuses here. In interviews this week, voters were generally more forgiving of Trump's controversial remarks than in other states -- insistent that the most important thing about his candidacy is that he can bring change (even if they aren't quite sure what that change will be). Dan Lingle, a welder from the Reno area, said the economy is so bad that he had to go back to work for himself. \"I'm 61 and white -- so things haven't been good for me at all,\" he said. \"A sense of entitlement is the only reason I think anybody would be voting for Hillary Clinton,\" Lingle said. \"We've got to get back to a country that's working. Even though he's a loose cannon, I think Trump would be better for Americans and jobs.... People are just fed up with the status quo. Anybody voting for Hillary right now is just voting for Obama again.... The world is ready for a woman president but not that one.\" So far Clinton -- and Trump, with his unforced errors -- have managed to make the election a referendum on Trump. But the coolness with which voters have greeted her in Nevada illustrate her weaknesses as a candidate. If Trump becomes a more disciplined candidate in the coming weeks, and begins to strike a more moderate tone -- as he did on immigration in an interview with Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday night -- Clinton could be facing an uphill climb in Nevada and other states. Democrats and some independent voters here say they are frightened by Trump's unpredictability. But some of that fear and uncertainty about Trump has been negated by the fact that Clinton is also widely distrusted. Larry McDaniel, a Democrat from Golden Valley, said he is voting for Trump because he doesn't trust the Clintons or \"the way they've moved money around\" from donors to their foundation. He disagreed with Trump's call for a Muslim travel ban and Trump's characterizations of undocumented immigrants, who he described as some of \"the most wonderful and trustworthy people I've known in my life.\" But Trump, McDaniel said, \"talks our language.\" \"Do I think all the people who are coming over (the border) are murderers and rapists? No, I don't. But do I think we need to protect our borders in a more reasonable manner? Yeah, I do,\" said McDaniel, a 69-year-old general contractor. \"He's not afraid of saying something that's not politically correct.\" \"Do I think he's his own worst enemy at times? Yeah, I really do,\" McDaniel continued. \"It's like 'Don't put your foot in your mouth again -- I'm trying to believe in you, but golly.\" Clinton's struggles with Democrats For all of Trump's flaws as a candidate, Clinton is struggling with trust issues even among women who are voting for her. \"I feel like I'm voting against someone as opposed to for someone,\" said Treva J. Hearne, 69-year-old attorney from Reno who was eating breakfast at the popular local diner known as Two Chicks. When Obama ran for president, Hearne was a precinct committeeman: \"I was out there every day working. I have done nothing (this cycle). Nothing.\" \"We're talking about the first woman president,\" said Hearne. \"Don't we want her to be a Michelle Obama-type? Somebody who rises above the fray. Somebody who is not so involved in politics that you feel as though they've been dirtied?\" \"This is the feeling you walk away with: that she was willing to do whatever it took to get where she is today,\" Hearne said. \"And I suppose, just being an old hippie, I really have a problem with that.\" Tom Malen, a 65-year-old Democrat from Reno, said he'll vote for Clinton even though he's not excited about either candidate. \"I think she would be stronger all the way around. She's a very smart lady. Donald Trump is too used to being in charge. He's too used to, 'My way.' This is the way it's going to be,\" Malen said. \"She knows politics. Donald only knows he's the board chairman and it's going to be 'My way.' Nah, not when you hit Congress pal. He only has X amount of power. He's not a king,\" Malen added. Democrats have won here in past election cycles by painting their opponents as too extreme on social issues --- making inroads with more libertarian leaning voters. It has been harder to paint Trump with that brush, because his position on abortion has evolved dramatically over the decades and he is viewed as more flexible on gay rights issues than other Republicans. Getting new Trump voters to the polls Still, the key to winning this state will be turnout and boosting voter registration, which has been a huge focus of both sides in recent years. George W. Bush narrowly won Nevada in 2000 and 2004 on the strength of his ground game and his unique appeal to the burgeoning population of Latino voters. But to make up for high Republican turnout here, Democrats have heavily ramped up their voter registration efforts, helping to lay the ground work for Obama's 12-point win over John McCain in 2008 and his nearly 7-point win over Mitt Romney in 2012. In part because of her fierce primary season battle against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton has a far more organized effort here than Trump -- one that existed long before the Nevada caucuses. As in other states, Trump is leaning heavily on the Republican National Committee to help him contact and persuade voters. Strategists here, however, note that because his outsider message resonated here, Trump blew away expectations for the Republican caucuses, winning in a landslide by drawing out many new GOP voters. Some 75,000 Republicans turned out for the caucuses, compared with just 33,000 when Mitt Romney ran in 2012. Because Trump voters and potential volunteers are new to the process, the Republican National Committee has increased the number of new volunteer trainings that they are conducting in the state to reinforce the importance of phone-banking, door-knocking and sustained voter contact -- underscoring the fact that merely showing up at Trump rallies will not help him win the state. A recent Suffolk University poll showing Clinton up 44% to 42% in Nevada suggests some geographic hurdles for Clinton, which is why her surrogates -- including Tim Kaine and Bill Clinton -- have been so visible here. In the Democratic stronghold of Clark County surrounding Las Vegas -- where Democrats can rely on the culinary workers and other labor unions to turn out voters in huge numbers -- Clinton is leading Trump by 13 points. Though Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot here, third party candidates like Libertarian Gary Johnson are siphoning some of the support away from the two major candidates. And in an even more intriguing sign of how polarizing both Clinton and Trump are among the electorate, 3% of respondents in Clark County said they would choose Nevada's \"none-of-these-candidates\" option on their ballot. Seven percent of voters were still undecided. In Washoe County, the state's bellwether, Trump led Clinton by three points in the Suffolk poll, making it a dead heat. That is a key reason why Clinton is campaigning in Reno on Thursday; and Trump will attend a local party fundraiser in Lake Tahoe on Friday night. Gun politics helping Trump Not surprisingly, Trump has a wide lead in the sparsely populated rural counties where even conservative Democrats are concerned that Clinton has moved too far to the left on gun rights. David Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, noted that one interesting finding in the university's poll was that the gender gap was less pronounced in Nevada than in other battleground states. He believes that is because Clinton is still struggling with gun owners, who make up 40% of likely voters in Nevada according to Suffolk's poll. In gun-owning households, Trump led among men 59% to 28% and led among women 56% to 33%, Paleologos said. In non-gun-owning households, the survey showed the reverse: Clinton led among men 59% to 29% and beat Trump among women 55% to 26%. \"To me, that's the key,\" Paleologos said. \"The places where the gender gap is neutralized is in gun ownership versus the non-gun ownership households.\" One of the initiatives on the ballot this year in Nevada would require any unlicensed person who wants to sell or transfer a firearm to another person to do the transfer through a gun dealer, who could conduct a background check on the potential buyer. At the moment, the measure has majority support, but the NRA is lobbying heavily against it -- a crosscurrent that could help bring out more pro-Trump voters. Thursday, Clinton is expected to attack Trump's \"alt-right\" message and paint him as out of step with Nevada voters, but she has yet to demonstrate that she has found her own message that resonates with voters here.",

A Suffolk University poll released Thursday shows Clinton is ahead of Trump in the Great Lake State by a 44% to 37% margin. Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson appears to have less appeal among likely voters compared to others in states around the country, with only 5% of respondents saying they would back him. Jill Stein, the Green Party's nominee, only garnered support from 3% of those surveyed. Ten percent told researchers they were still undecided. Polls: Tight in North Carolina while Trump tops in Arizona This latest poll solidifies Michigan's support for Clinton after Bernie Sanders won the Democratic primary with 49.7% of the vote March 8. The numbers are a positive sign for Clinton in a state that handily elected President Barack Obama in 2008 with 57% of the vote before returning him to the White House by 54% in 2012. Read More But the poll also found the Clinton campaign still had work to do to improve their principal's favorability ratings, with just 28% of respondents saying they thought Clinton was honest and trustworthy in contrast to 63% who did not. Trump engendered similarly negative responses, with a 35% trustworthy to 53% untrustworthy breakdown. Poll: Clinton up big on Trump in Virginia The key issue on the minds of those polled were jobs and the economy (21%), followed closely by terrorism and national security (20%) and potential Supreme Court nominees (11%). Interestingly, when asked about their feelings towards the upcoming presidential election, 61% of respondents said they were alarmed by the state of the race. Eleven percent said they were \"bored,\" while only 20% felt excited about casting a ballot on November 8. The Suffolk University poll surveyed 500 likely voters in Michigan over the telephone between August 22 and 24. Its findings have a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. Sections",

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON Immigration advocates on Thursday mounted a long-shot effort to revive part of U.S. President Barack Obama's plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation by filing a lawsuit challenging the national scope of a court order that blocked it. \nWith favorable court rulings, the lawyers filing the lawsuit say it has the long-term potential to unravel decisions that blocked Obama's November 2014 plan nationwide. The White House program, if it had been fully implemented, could have allowed up to four million people with no legal immigration status to obtain work authorization. \nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of Martin Batalla Vidal, 25, an immigrant from Mexico who has lived in the United States since he was seven and has benefited from the program. \nHe initially received a three-year work authorization, which has now been revoked due to a Texas judge's ruling in February 2015 that blocked Obama's plan. Texas and 25 other states had challenged it. \nVidal would still be eligible for a two-year work authorization under an earlier program, which has not been challenged and was not covered by the injunction. \nVidal's lawyers at the National Immigration Law Center say that if he wins, the ruling could have broad implications because it could help to eventually reinstate Obama's program for up to 60 percent of potential applicants in parts of the country not covered by the Texas ruling. \nThe Texas judge's ruling was upheld on appeal. On June 23, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on the case, leaving the appeals court decision in place. \nThe court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to rehear the case once it has a full complement of justices. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Alistair Bell) Trending Stories ",

Colombia: 52 years of war, 220,000 dead, now peace By Rachel Clarke, CNN Updated 1757 GMT (0157 HKT) August 25, 2016 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Sealed with a handshake: Colombian government representative Humberto de la Calle, right, and FARC commander Ivan Marquez greet each other after signing a peace deal in Havana. Story highlights After five decades of war, Colombia and a rebel group sign a peace deal FARC guerrillas have promised to lay down their weapons and rejoin society (CNN) The end seems near for one of the world's longest running conflicts, with the announcement of a peace deal between the government of Colombia and the Marxist rebels of FARC. Here's what you need to know: A brief history of the war It's been a devastating war, with more than five decades of battle between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (known by the Spanish acronym FARC) and the country's government. It began in 1964, after the success of the Cuban revolution, with the rebels wanting to forcibly redistribute wealth. Read More An undated picture shows Ingrid Betancourt during her time as a FARC hostage in the jungle. In the more than 50 years since then, the armed group has seized territory, attacked government forces and interfered with political life through high-profile kidnappings. The rebels hijacked a commercial airliner to kidnap a senator in 2002, one of at least three passenger plane hijackings in the early part of the century. One of the group's most notorious feats was the capture of presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt in 2002, who was held deep in the jungle for six years before she was rescued in a Colombian military operation. FARC also turned to the drug trade, making millions from trafficking in cocaine. It was designated a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. The rebels forced children to become soldiers, training them as guerrillas to lay mines and fight. As the decades passed, thousands upon thousands of people were killed. Up to 220,000 died in the insurgency and as many as 5 million people were displaced -- more than 1 out of every 10 Colombians. The long, bumpy road to a peace deal There have been sporadic attempts at peace since the 1980s. A ceasefire brokered in 1984 included the release of a number of imprisoned guerrilla fighters. That truce ended in 1990 when several thousand former FARC members were killed. Another attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. Talks about talks began again in August 2012 and the two sides met in Havana the following November. Cuban President Raul Castro presided over the negotiations that went on (and off and on) for four years before a ceasefire deal was signed this June . That was another step on the way to the full peace deal, signed Wednesday by President Juan Manuel Santos and rebel leaders. What's next The deal needs to be approved by a majority of Colombian citizens and a referendum has been set for October 2. The plan is that FARC rebels will lay down their arms and leave their jungle strongholds. A FARC guerrilla listens during a class on the peace process and how life will be in the future. The leaders of FARC have said they will switch to a political track, taking their battle from the countryside to the polls, starting a party to win seats in Colombia's congress. The reintegration of the fighters and all those affected by the insurgency will be key. The government has promised training programs to help. The reaction Colombians celebrate in their capital, Bogota, as the deal is signed. So far, so good. The key players are hailing the deal, President Barack Obama and US officials praised the triumph of democracy and Colombians celebrated on the streets. Economists also see an opportunity for a peace dividend. Felicitaciones, @JuanManSantos and Colombia. After decades of war, we stand with you in building a future of peace. https://t.co/haXJaqgS9f — President Obama (@POTUS) August 25, 2016 CNN's Patrick Oppmann and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.",

Seeking to forever tie Donald Trump to the \"alt-right\" and its media icons, Hillary Clinton on Thursday delivered a stemwinding indictment of Trump and his embrace of extreme conservative media, rhetoric and conspiracy theories. \nThe speech, in Reno, Nev., used Trump's connections to outlets like Breitbart, InfoWars and the National Enquirer to portray him as a dangerous man living in a \"paranoid fever dream.\" \nThe Republican nominee was not only exploiting \"a paranoid fringe in our politics, steeped in racial resentment,\" Clinton said, but \"stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone\" in a way no presidential candidate had ever done before. \n\"This is what happens when you treat the National Enquirer like Gospel,\" Clinton said of Trump's promotion of various conspiracy theories, including his suggestion that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination and his assertion that President Barack Obama founded ISIS. \n\"It's what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. He said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there,\" she continued. \"Trump didn't challenge those lies. He went on Jones' show and said: 'Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.'\" \nBut Clinton reserved her most damning critique for Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News chief who was recently appointed CEO of Trump's campaign. \nRelated: Steve Bannon: The \"street fighter\" who's now running Trump's campaign \n\"The de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump Campaign represents a landmark achievement for the 'Alt-Right,' a fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party,\" Clinton said. \"This is part of a broader story -- the rising tide of hardline, right-wing nationalism around the world.\" \nAt one point, Clinton simply listed off a number of Breitbart headlines that championed the Confederate flag, criticized women and feminism, and referred to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, the victim of a mass shooting, as a \"human shield.\" \n\"He says he wants to 'make America great again,'\" Clinton said of Trump, \"but his real message remains 'Make America hate again.'\" \nTrump responded to the speech shortly after Clinton was done, saying in two tweets that she was \"pandering to the worst instincts in our society,\" and that \"[s]he should be ashamed of herself! Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary 's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016 Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself! — Donald J.

	      "text": "Down Ticket is Yahoo News’ complete guide to the most fascinating House, Senate and governors’ races of 2016. Coming to you every Tuesday and Thursday until Nov. 8. What you need to know today. \nThis Republican Senate candidate is showing the rest of the GOP how not to get dragged down by the Donald On Tuesday, we took a breather from cataloging the many Donald Trump-related problems facing down-ballot Republicans in order to point out that, hey, maybe not everything is doom and gloom for the GOP right now.\nOne of the bright spots: Three vulnerable Republican senators — Marco Rubio in Florida, Rob Portman in Ohio, Chuck Grassley in Iowa — are leading their Democratic challengers in swing states where Trump is nonetheless trailing or tied with Hillary Clinton.\nTurns out, however, that there’s a fourth GOP Senate candidate who may be an even better example of how Republicans can save themselves from Trump.\nHis name is Joe Heck, and he’s running for Harry Reid’s seat in Nevada.\nAs you may have heard, Reid — a 30-year veteran of the chamber who served as majority leader from 2007 to 2015 and is probably the second most powerful Democrat in the country — will be retiring in January. There is no race Republicans are more determined to win: in part to ensure that they keep control of the Senate, and in part to embarrass Reid.\nDemocrat Catherine Cortez Masto should be the favorite. She is Reid’s handpicked successor, which means she is backed by the minority leader’s powerful political machine and a Nevada Democratic Party that is much more organized than the state’s notoriously sloppy GOP. ( Reid himself has said that he is “devoting a huge amount of my time” to the race.) As the granddaughter of an immigrant from Chihuahua, Mexico , she would be the first Latina senator in U.S. history — a leg up in a state with a large Latino population (28 percent) that votes heavily Democratic. (Barack Obama won 71 percent of Nevada’s Latino vote in 2012). From 2007 to 2015, she served as Nevada’s attorney general, one of the highest-profile offices in the state. And in general, Democrats — who enjoy a statewide voter-registration advantage over Republicans — tend to benefit from presidential-year turnout patterns in Nevada.\nYet Cortez Masto hasn’t led in a single poll since May; in fact, Heck is slightly ahead at this point, according to the RealClear Politics average . Trump, meanwhile, lags a few points behind Clinton .\nThis wasn’t what the pundits predicted. “If there was any state where Trump would hurt the chances of down-ballot congressional candidates, Nevada was supposed to be it,” the Washington Post’s Dave Weigel recently wrote . “President Obama carried it twice, both times losing the white vote but winning landslides with the state’s enormous Latino population. [But now] Nevada is the only competitive Senate race in the nation where Democrats are playing defense.”\nSo what’s going on?\nLike Rubio, Portman and Grassley, Heck is running ahead of his party’s presidential nominee because he is defining himself in a way that keeps Trump from defining him. Unlike Rubio, Portman and Grassley, however, Heck (a congressman from Nevada’s third district) is doing so as a non-incumbent in a race for an open Democratic seat. This makes his early success more impressive — and potentially more instructive for other down-ballot Republicans.\nOn paper, Heck looks like exactly the sort of candidate Republicans would want on their team: a physician and a brigadier general in the Army Reserve who has served three tours of active duty . He also has an excellent track record at the ballot box, having narrowly defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2010 before going on to win reelection by widening margins in 2012 and 2014, in a district that twice voted for Obama.\nAlso important: As one Democratic strategist recently told top Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston , “in Congress, [Heck] has represented 25 percent of the voters of the state, and three-quarters of the voters are in [the] same media market as his congressional district, so he started better defined than Catherine.”\nView photos \n“We knew this race would be tough,” the Democrat added. “He has a good biography as a general and a doctor, so negatives have hit him less hard in past campaigns.”\nBut the key for Heck — at least so far — is that he’s actually delivered on this promise as a candidate. ( Outside money is helping as well .) On the one hand, Heck hasn’t fallen into the same trap as his Republican counterparts in New Hampshire and elsewhere by trying to have it both ways on Trump ; he supports the Donald and doesn’t squirm when he says so. But he’s also made it clear that he’d bring a very non-Trumpian set of priorities to the Senate.\nChief among them: immigration reform. Heck was one of the few GOP congressmen who supported the Gang of Eight’s 2013 push for comprehensive reform. He read all 1,200 pages of Senate bill, and though he objected to portions of it, he planned to work on a House version. When House Republicans eventually decided to kill the legislation, Heck released a statement saying the situation was “ extremely frustrating and very disappointing .” He spent six months drafting a GOP version of the DREAM Act; he criticizes Trump’s proposed Muslim ban for “stereotyp[ing]” “1.6 billion people”; and when asked about Trump’s mass deportation plan, he insists that “ we could not execute it and we could not afford it .” He says that he would continue to advocate for immigration reform as a senator under President Trump.\n“It’s hard to predict what the future’s going to hold, but that’s the position I’d take on the Senate side,” Heck told the Washington Post . “Being a smaller body, it might be easier to build a critical mass of consensus than trying to do it in a group of 435.”\nTo be sure, Heck and Trump overlap on some immigration-related issues . But for the most part, Heck has convinced his diverse district — where he has consistently reached out to minority groups, “ arranging discussions about improving Hispanic health care and employing Mandarin and Tagalog speakers on his congressional staff ” — that he isn’t anything like Trump.\nNot that Heck’s opponents agree. The Democrats’ plan is to paint Heck as a Trump clone: Last month, Cortez Masto described Heck and Trump as “ideological soul mates,” and Reid has referred to his protégée’s rival as both a “parrot” and “Joe ‘I’m Really Trump’ Heck.”\nIn response, Heck has accused Cortez Masto of being little more than Reid 2.0 and claiming that, of the two of them, only he would hold leaders of both parties accountable.\nIn a state where neither Reid, Clinton, nor Trump is particularly popular right now, the contest — and perhaps even control of the Senate as a whole — may come down to which argument Nevadans find more convincing. The fact that more of them seem to be supporting Heck than Trump — and fewer seem to be supporting Cortez Masto than Clinton — suggests that the congressman may currently have the upper hand.\nWhether Heck can eke out a victory remains to be seen. Still, no other GOP candidate is handling Hurricane Donald quite as deftly. His fellow Republicans should take note.\n\nThe sockless senator North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr is many things. A former lawn equipment salesman. The twelfth cousin of Aaron Burr. The driver of a 1974 Volkswagen Thing .\nOne thing Burr is not, however, is a wearer of socks. This week, he decided to explain his aversion via video tweet. It is officially our favorite clip of the 2016 election cycle (so far):\nI’m not opposed to socks, I just choose not to wear them. https://t.co/VP8Nqjh1E0 \n— Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) August 23, 2016 \nBurr will undoubtedly remain sockless after November’s election. The question is whether he will remain a senator. A NBC/Marist poll taken earlier this month showed Burr’s Democratic rival, Deborah Ross, ahead by two percentage points; two polls released earlier this week awarded Burr narrow leads . The contest is becoming a somewhat unexpected tossup as Trump underperforms in the state and Democratic challenger Roy Cooper pulls away from GOP incumbent Pat McCrory in the governor’s race.\nFor the record: Down Ticket sometimes goes sockless as well. It’s a southern New Jersey thing. (Not really.)\n\nCheat sheet: This year’s most fascinating ballot initiatives View photos \nBy Chris Wilson \nMarijuana: Several ballot initiatives across the country seek to legalize weed to varying degrees. In Massachusetts, a victory for Question 4 would make it legal to grow, possess and distribute marijuana for all residents over the age of 21. The state voted in 2008 to decriminalize possession and in 2012, approved the use of medical marijuana. Arizona, California, Maine and Nevada also have measures that would legalize weed for recreational purposes. Marijuana is currently legal for recreational purposes in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.\nFlorida, North Dakota and Arkansas have initiatives to legalize cannabis for medical purposes. In 2014, Florida’s Amendment 2 — which would have created a constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana — fell two points short of the 60 percent threshold it needed to reach. Montana has Initiative 182, which would remove a licensed marijuana provider’s three-patient limit. Missouri also considered a medical marijuana initiative, but it failed to make November’s ballot.\nSouth Dakota Referred Law 20: At the conclusion of an election cycle that saw Bernie Sanders putting a national $15 minimum wage front and center, South Dakota voters will have the opportunity to lower the statewide minimum wage for some residents, two years after voting to raise it for all of them.\nConfusing? Let’s break it down. In November 2014, South Dakota residents voted 55 percent to 45 percent for Measure 18, which raised the minimum wage in the state from $7.25 per hour to $8.50 per hour, along with annual cost-of-living adjustments. The following year, Gov. Dennis Daugaard signed a bill that exempted South Dakota residents under the age of 18 from the increase, bumping their minimum wage up just a quarter to $7.50 and untethering minors from any automatic cost-of-living increases. Supporters of the measure said the point was to create a “ youth training wage ” for younger workers.\n“I don’t think it is an affront to the will of the voters,” Daugaard said last year , despite overturning part of a measure that passed by 10 points a few months earlier. “Again, I think that campaign focused on adult workers who support a household and not on teenagers.”\nThat leads us to Referred Law 20, which will be on the ballot in November after a group opposing the lower wage for young workers successfully filed a petition . A yes vote will lock in the minimum wage for minors at $7.50 without any automatic increases, while a no vote would restore the law to what South Dakota residents voted on two years ago. It is one of a few states with a minimum wage measure on the ballot; the others are Colorado, Maine and Washington. The Washington measure (Initiative 1433) would also give residents the opportunity to earn paid sick leave in addition to boosting the minimum wage.\nCalifornia: The Golden State has a robust ballot-initiative process that lets voters to decide on a variety of issues every election cycle. A few of the items on the ballot this November:\nProposition 62: Repeal the use of the death penalty in the state. California has not executed a prisoner since 2006. Proposition 63: A gun control measure that would prohibit high-capacity magazines and require background checks for the purchase of ammunition. Proposition 64: As mentioned above, this would legalize recreational marijuana in the state. Proposition 67: Prohibit the use of plastic bags at large grocery stores and other retailers. And then you have Proposition 60, which would require pornographic actors to use condoms.\nColorado Amendment 69: Some strange bedfellows have come together to oppose this initiative, which would create a universal health care program for all the state’s residents. Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Michael Bennet, both Democrats, oppose the measure, claiming it would hurt businesses and increase taxes . Meanwhile, health care companies and the Koch brothers’ organization Americans for Prosperity are spending money to defeat it. Polling in June showed the yes votes in the lead, but Amendment 69’s chances of passage have declined since then. State Sen. Irene Aguilar, an early advocate for the amendment, admitted earlier this week that she’d consider support from 35 percent of the state’s voters a moral victory.\n\nWant a sneak peek of the message down-ballot Republicans will be running on this fall? Paul Ryan’s got you covered. View photos \n… and surprise: It doesn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump.\nFor the past few weeks, the political press has been speculating about when the Republican Party will pull a Dole ’96 and start publicly pushing a “blank check” message, essentially conceding a Trump loss and campaigning instead to preserve their congressional majorities as a brake on the liberal ambitions of President Hillary Clinton.\nBut Paul Ryan is already there.\nHere’s a fundraising email the House majority leader sent out Wednesday:\nView photos \nAs Paul Ryan goes, so goes the GOP. Expect more of this in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe best of the rest Bernie Sanders launches “Our Revolution,” while @Tim_Canova accuses him of ignoring his calls https://t.co/dfVAysgxZE \n— daveweigel (@daveweigel) August 25, 2016 \nI went to Indy to write on @EvanBayh and #insen , and my trip began by sharing a DCA-IND flight with …..

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Clinton's alt-right con trick By Timothy Stanley Updated 2304 GMT (0704 HKT) August 25, 2016 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Clinton: Trump spreads message of white supremacists 01:11 Story highlights Hillary Clinton delivers a speech Thursday attacking the so-called alt-right Timothy Stanley: Clinton created an imagined relationship between everyday, mainstream conservatives and the alt-right Timothy Stanley, a conservative, is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \" Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics. \" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) There were two big winners in Hillary Clinton's speech on the alt-right . One was Hillary Clinton, who was able to present herself as the opponent of a neo-racist movement. The other was the alt-right, which hardly anyone had ever heard of and which got some free advertising. The big loser of the night was the Republican Party. Most of its activists had probably never heard of the alt-right either. Now their label is tarred with it. Never mind that the alt-right is tiny and unrepresentative of conservatism, or even that Trump has allied with alt-right figures but never endorsed the movement by name. These are details that Clinton doesn't benefit from so she didn't dwell on them. Timothy Stanley What exactly is the alt-right then? Come back and ask in about 30 years' time. It's too soon to be exact about a movement so diffuse and containing so many factions, some disputing the label. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH Clinton ties Trump to white supremacists, anti-Semites 02:42 To put it generously, alt-righters are conservatives who are as critical of the Republicans as they are the Democrats -- believing both to be slaves of political correctness. Put ungenerously, they tend to preach a white rights, hypermasculine identity politics that comes off like sheer bigotry. Notably, they contain few Christian groups. They are post-Christian, almost post-capitalist, rather obsessed with biology. The American Renaissance, an alt-right group, posted a response to Clinton's speech, arguing: \"If whites really understood the racial implications of what she stands for, they wouldn't vote for her as dog catcher.\" Read More Trump doesn't understand what Sharia is (Opinion) American Renaissance adds: \"We do not claim that Donald Trump is part of the alt-right or that he is an advocate for white people. It is clearly unfair to make him responsible for our views. However, by promoting polices that put America first, he will slow our decline and perhaps even pave the way to an American Renaissance in which the truth about race is no longer a taboo.\" When future historians write about the alt-right they may well quote Clinton's speech. It was important. She drew a spurious line of influence from Vladimir Putin to Britain's Nigel Farage -- who addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi on Wednesday -- to Trump himself, who is, said Clinton, the agent of the alt-right's takeover of the Republican Party. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH Donald Trump doubles down on Clinton 'bigot' comment 01:22 This is too slick an interpretation. In reality, Farage, the British nationalist, has consistently said there are profound cultural differences between British and American conservatives, particularly over the importance of religion. T rump, meanwhile, may channel alt-right ideas or provide a platform for them , but it's not clear that his overall philosophy is theirs. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook And Putin's supposed influence over right-wing politics is overblown. We're in danger of entering McCarthyite waters when anyone who suggests that confrontation with Russia is unnecessary is painted as an agent of foreign influence. Trumpism is not alt-right, the alt-right is not Trump, and neither is some plot by the KGB. But Trumpism isn't mainstream conservatism either, and neither is the alt-right. Don't get me wrong: There's a reason why the alt-right has found a home with the Republicans rather than the Democrats. Since the 1960s, the GOP's rhetoric has made it a more natural fit for those who think only African-Americans get welfare or that feminists are worse than cancer (the latter a famous Breitbart headline quoted by Clinton when she mentioned that the Trump campaign's new CEO is the executive chairman of Breitbart). Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Donald Trump has gone from outsider to controversial front-runner in the race to become the Republican Party's 2016 presidential candidate. Trump began his bid with an announcement speech on June 16, calling for a massive wall on the U.S. border with Mexico -- for which he said he would make Mexico pay. At this stage he was tied for 10th place in the polls , at just 3%. Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On week five of the campaign, Trump turned on Sen. John McCain at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa. McCain is regarded by many as a war hero after being captured and held in Vietnam for more than five years. After the comments, Republicans rushed to condemn Trump, with rival candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham calling him \"a jackass.\" Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes During the Republican presidential debate on August 6, Megyn Kelly pressed Trump about misogynistic , sexist comments he made in the past, such as calling some women \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\"Trump slammed Kelly for this, calling her questions \"ridiculous\" and \"off-base.\" After the first GOP presidential debate, Trump said: \"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes ... blood coming out of her... wherever.\" Many accused him of making a lewd comment about menstruation. Trump told CNN 's State of the Union that only a \"deviant\" or \"sick\" person would think otherwise. On ABC's This Week , Trump said: \"I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question.\" Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes In an effort to defend himself from critics of his remarks about the Fox anchor, Trump explained why it is hard for others to insult him -- his own good looks. Trump spoke about the backlash on NBC, saying: \"There's nothing to apologize (for). I thought she asked a very, very unfair question.\" Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Trump was quoted in Rolling Stone magazine on September 9, mocking Republican rival Carly Fiorina's appearance. On the same day, Trump told crowds: \"We are led by very, very stupid people.\" Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On October 5, Donald Trump said there would be a \"collapse\" and \"depression\" in television ratings if he ended his presidential campaign. Later Trump suggested he would skip a CNN debate unless the network gave him $5 million. CNN refused, and Trump later backtracked. Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On November 22, Trump repeated his claim -- widely regarded as false -- that he saw television reports of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 terrorist attacks. No footage to back up Trump's assertions has been found. Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes In the wake of December's San Bernardino , California, shootings, Trump called for a travel ban on all Muslims from entering the United States \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" He did not give details on how Muslims would be identified, but the Republican candidate did not rule out special identification cards. Hide Caption 8 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Donald Trump has developed an unlikely bromance with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Trump had previously praised Putin as a leader he would \"get along very well with.\" Then, on December 17, Putin further stoked the flame, describing Trump as \"a bright and talented person.\" This led Trump in turn to make more positive comments about the Russian leader. Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes An unrelenting Trump took the run-up to Christmas as a chance to insult Democrat hopeful Hillary Clinton. He said Clinton's bathroom break in a TV debate was \"disgusting\" before saying she \"got schlonged\" by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race. \"Schlong\" is a Yiddish word for penis. Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On January 24, Donald Trump boasted at a campaign rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, that support for his presidential campaign would not decline even if he shot someone in the middle of a crowded street. Hide Caption 11 of 11 But there are angels within the Republican Party, and those with a clear-eyed understanding of the moral precepts of conservatism resist this trend. Long before Clinton gave this speech, Mitt Romney attacked Trump for his alleged racism . Commentators like Ben Shapiro -- as far to the right of the sane spectrum you can get without falling off into madness -- have condemned his bigotry also . Conservatism is as hard to define as the alt-right. And at a moment when people are fighting over its meaning, it's important to establish what it's not. How Trump's health smear of Clinton backfired Conservatism, as mainstream Republicans have long defined it, preaches the supremacy of the individual, in limited government and in the noble idea that you and I were created equal. There is no room in that philosophy for the dirty lie of racism. It attaches itself parasitically to it from time to time, but is generally shaken off. Hence, Clinton has pulled off a con trick. Yes, she has denounced folks who needed to be denounced. Yes, she has forced conservatives like me to test our conscience regarding Trump. But she has also created an imagined relationship between everyday, mainstream conservatives and the alt-right. Don't be fooled. Clinton did not call out the alt-right to save the GOP from it, but to condemn it by association. Let me spell it out with all the clarity I can squeeze from the keyboard. Racism is un-American. It is unchristian. It is unconservative.",

	      "text": "MUST WATCH Clinton: Trump spreads message of white supremacists 01:11 Why? Clinton depicted Trump as the rogue politician he is, one who qualitatively differs from all previous GOP nominees. Rogues (whether states or individuals) operate outside accepted norms or principles. This makes them seductive to some, even as they are a threat to most. Trump positioned himself in this role from the very start. His first alt-right retweets sent a clear sign to disaffected white males: I will fix things, and I'll do it outside, and against, the system. I'll say, and show, what others are too cowardly to admit. I'll make it safe for you to speak publicly, rather than in hushed tones at the local bar or gun show. Read More And so, from last fall onward, in the alt-right echo chamber online we had Hispanics depicted as border-crossing monkeys, and African-Americans as thugs; and we even had Trump himself casting women as disgusting, fluid-filled creatures; Jews as moneygrubbers. Trump used Twitter as a focus group for his new brand: Trump, savior of white rights and white civilization. In one week in January 2016 , 62% of Trump's tweets had white nationalist origins or connections. Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Donald Trump has gone from outsider to controversial front-runner in the race to become the Republican Party's 2016 presidential candidate. Trump began his bid with an announcement speech on June 16, calling for a massive wall on the U.S. border with Mexico -- for which he said he would make Mexico pay. At this stage he was tied for 10th place in the polls , at just 3%. Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On week five of the campaign, Trump turned on Sen. John McCain at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa. McCain is regarded by many as a war hero after being captured and held in Vietnam for more than five years. After the comments, Republicans rushed to condemn Trump, with rival candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham calling him \"a jackass.\" Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes During the Republican presidential debate on August 6, Megyn Kelly pressed Trump about misogynistic , sexist comments he made in the past, such as calling some women \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\"Trump slammed Kelly for this, calling her questions \"ridiculous\" and \"off-base.\" After the first GOP presidential debate, Trump said: \"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes ... blood coming out of her... wherever.\" Many accused him of making a lewd comment about menstruation. Trump told CNN 's State of the Union that only a \"deviant\" or \"sick\" person would think otherwise. On ABC's This Week , Trump said: \"I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question.\" Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes In an effort to defend himself from critics of his remarks about the Fox anchor, Trump explained why it is hard for others to insult him -- his own good looks. Trump spoke about the backlash on NBC, saying: \"There's nothing to apologize (for). I thought she asked a very, very unfair question.\" Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Trump was quoted in Rolling Stone magazine on September 9, mocking Republican rival Carly Fiorina's appearance. On the same day, Trump told crowds: \"We are led by very, very stupid people.\" Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On October 5, Donald Trump said there would be a \"collapse\" and \"depression\" in television ratings if he ended his presidential campaign. Later Trump suggested he would skip a CNN debate unless the network gave him $5 million. CNN refused, and Trump later backtracked. Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On November 22, Trump repeated his claim -- widely regarded as false -- that he saw television reports of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 terrorist attacks. No footage to back up Trump's assertions has been found. Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes In the wake of December's San Bernardino , California, shootings, Trump called for a travel ban on all Muslims from entering the United States \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" He did not give details on how Muslims would be identified, but the Republican candidate did not rule out special identification cards. Hide Caption 8 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Donald Trump has developed an unlikely bromance with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Trump had previously praised Putin as a leader he would \"get along very well with.\" Then, on December 17, Putin further stoked the flame, describing Trump as \"a bright and talented person.\" This led Trump in turn to make more positive comments about the Russian leader. Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes An unrelenting Trump took the run-up to Christmas as a chance to insult Democrat hopeful Hillary Clinton. He said Clinton's bathroom break in a TV debate was \"disgusting\" before saying she \"got schlonged\" by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race. \"Schlong\" is a Yiddish word for penis. Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes On January 24, Donald Trump boasted at a campaign rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, that support for his presidential campaign would not decline even if he shot someone in the middle of a crowded street. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Twitter also became Trump's virtual police force, on the hunt for any criticism of the leader and quick to strike. So many of us who have written about Trump have been harassed and threatened, especially if we seem to depart from the white Christian mold. I can tell you from the vitriol posted on my own feed that deportation trends right now, as opposed to cremation ovens a few months ago. Is it any wonder David Duke, former head of the Ku Klux Klan, feels emboldened to run for office? Or that former UN Ambassador John Bolton, speaking on Fox News Thursday, feels free to say that people are being destructive if they identify as black or Hispanic? This fringe, angling itself into the mainstream, courtesy of Trump, wants (nonwhite) race to just go quiet, and go away. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook That's why Clinton's head-on confrontation with Trump's racism in this speech is so necessary and powerful. She reminded us that Trump removed black dealers from his casinos; that federal investigators said he refused to rent to blacks and Hispanics; and that he provided, Clinton said, \"a steady stream of bigotry\" that has energized a segment of America that no longer recognized itself or its interests in the GOP. Clinton demonstrated that Trump's rogue identity depends on his embrace of conspiracy theories, many of them revolving around President Obama. By delegitimizing the current President on racial grounds, Trump builds up his own model of leadership, one built around loyalty to his person rather than a political party. The tragedy of the GOP formed a subtheme of Clinton's speech, and a subtext of her appeal to bipartisan voters. Trump's latest tweet is no surprise (Opinion) She evoked a Republican Party that might seem quaint and unfamiliar to those whose introduction to politics has been this unusual election campaign. She recalled Sen. Bob Dole asking racists to leave the room as he accepted the presidential nomination in 1996; Sen. John McCain, reining in, rather than inciting racism, against Obama in the course of his failed 2008 presidential campaign. Clinton did not have to add that both these men now endorse Trump to make clear how far the GOP has fallen. \"I will be a President for all Americans,\" she said, meaning disillusioned conservatives as well as people of all ages, races and genders. Donald Trump and the battle for the soul of America This inclusiveness, which has shaped this electoral season as the Democrats' national hook, is Clinton's strongest suit. It's a hedge against Trump's divisiveness and doomsday scenarios, but also an opportunity for her to demonstrate her compassion and further humanize herself to voters. Perhaps her best moment in this regard was when she expressed sadness that Trump was missing so much by focusing on black communities in purely a negative vein. Clinton's alt-right con trick (Opinion) As I watched Clinton's speech on YouTube, I also scanned an adjacent feed that quickly became a blur of racial slurs and insults. The contrast between the sentiments expressed on the two halves of my computer screen was striking. Millions of Americans know this river of hate all too well: They swim in it. Others have been reluctant to acknowledge how great Trump's influence has been in this regard. Clinton showed leadership in addressing it head-on in Reno. Other political leaders, from both parties, should follow.",

TO MOVE WITH SPECIAL REPORT USA-DELAWARE/BULLOCK REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By Roberta Rampton | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama will dramatically expand the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii on Friday, the White House said, an action that will ban commercial fishing from more than 582,500 sq miles (1.5 million sq km) of the Pacific Ocean. \nObama will visit the protected area on Sept. 1 to draw attention to the threat that climate change poses to oceans, traveling to Midway Atoll - a remote coral reef that was the site of a pivotal World War Two battle and is now known for its sea turtles, monk seals, and millions of seabirds. \nObama, who was born in Hawaii and spent most of his childhood there, made curbing climate change a central part of his time in the White House, which draws to a close on Jan. 20. \nSome of his efforts have been blocked by Congress or held up in court challenges. But preserving public space from development has been something Obama can do using his own power, and he had moved to permanently protect more than 265 million acres of land and water even before the expansion in Hawaii. \nObama has also sought to use the star power of his office to raise public concern about climate issues. Trailed by camera crews, he has hiked on an Alaska glacier and walked through the Florida Everglades. \nHis journey to Midway Atoll, a former naval base that is now a rarely visited refuge, is aimed at sending a hopeful message. \n\"The best science shows that the ocean can recover, if you allow it to,\" said Senator Brian Schatz, who worked with scientists, environmental groups and native Hawaiians to urge Obama to expand the monument. \n\"As daunting as the problem of climate change is, and as troubling as the situation is with respect to our oceans, they show remarkable resilience, if you give them a chance,\" Schatz told Reuters. \nThe monument was first established 10 years ago by former Republican President George W. Bush, who created the world's largest marine reserve at the time, protecting close to 140,000 sq miles of ocean around the Hawaiian archipelago and inspiring a series of similar projects around the world. \nThe four-fold boost in territory will cover an area with more than 7,000 marine species, including a coral that is the world's oldest-known living organism at 4,265 years old. \n\"We think of Papahānaumokuākea's original designation as a catalyst, and we're hoping it will be again,\" said Seth Horstmeyer, a director with Pew's Global Ocean Legacy project. Only about 3 percent of the world's oceans have similar protections, according to Pew. \n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Sandra Maler and Paul Tait) Trending Stories ",

	      "text": "Zaevion Dobson was killed while protecting three girls during a shooting in December He has been honored by ESPYS Award and mentioned by President Obama Two suspects were charged in his death (CNN) A 15-year-old jumped on top of his friends to shield them from a spray of gunfire. Zaevion William Dobson's selfless act was his last. In December, Dobson, who was a sophomore high school football player in Knoxville, Tennessee, had been with his friends when two men approached the group and began firing. Dobson protected three girls who were not injured. His final act caught the attention of President Barack Obama, who tweeted shortly after his death that Dobson was \"a hero at 15.\" He was posthumously honored with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2016 ESPYS. On Thursday, two suspects were charged with first-degree murder in the death of Dobson. Christopher Bassett & Richard Williams charged w/1st Degree Murder in December shooting death of Zaevion Dobson. pic.twitter.com/BScqWiPODq — Knoxville Police (@Knoxville_PD) August 25, 2016 Christopher Bassett and Richard Williams face numerous charges, including attempted murder of eight other people. They are both being held on a $1 million bond, Knox County District Attorney Charme Allen said in a news conference covered by CNN affiliate WATE. Read More Both men are charged with additional counts of attempted first-degree murder and employing a firearm during a felony. Bassett faces additional counts of unlawful possession of a weapon. Dobson and his friends had been sitting on the front porch of one of their relative's house when the suspects approached. Faith Gordon, 17, who was one of the teens saved by Dobson, told WATE what happened that day. \"We were only there for like 15 minutes. We were just sitting there talking and laughing, and next thing you know, it's like a couple of guys... they walk, they just stop, and they stand for awhile and we're all trying to figure out like what's going on, what they're doing, who they are. They started shooting,\" she said. Dobson's brother said it was the teenager's dream to be a football player or a coach. CNN's Jill Martin and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.",

The nominees will be attorney Patricia Ann Millett (R),... REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON When President Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, the federal appeals court based in Virginia was known as one of the most conservative benches in the country. \nTwo Obama terms later, Democratic appointees hold a 10-5 majority on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a panel of which issued a groundbreaking ruling this April backing transgender rights. \nThe shift to the left on the court, which hears cases from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, highlights a widely overlooked aspect of Obama's legacy. \nHis appointments of dozens of judges to the country's influential federal appeals courts have tilted the judiciary in a liberal direction that will influence rulings for years to come and be further entrenched if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins this November's presidential election. \nA Reuters review of rulings by the courts over the last two years shows Obama’s appointees to the appeals courts have influenced major legal battles likely to ultimately reach the Supreme Court. \nObama-appointed judges have voted in favor of broad civil rights protections, major Obama administration regulations and gun regulations and against Republican-backed voting rules. \n(FACTBOX on recent rulings: [L1N1B41BM]) \n(Graphic showing the changes under Obama tmsnrt.rs/2blUhmV ) \nWhen seeking to appoint judges, the White House has said it is looking for highly credentialed lawyers reflecting the diversity of U.S. society. Conservative critics say he has picked judges who are willing to circumvent the law in order to reach preferred outcomes. \n\"There’s no question President Obama’s nominees have absolutely been part of his effort to transform the country and move it dramatically to the left,\" said Carrie Severino, a conservative legal activist. \nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that Obama's appointees \"all share impeccable qualifications, unquestioned integrity, and a steadfast commitment to equal justice under the law.\" \nThe appeals courts are the first stop for any case appealed from the lower U.S. district courts and often have the last word. The next and final destination is the Supreme Court, but it hears fewer than 100 cases a year. The appeals courts handle 35,000 a year according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \nOf the 13 appeals courts, nine now have a majority of Democratic appointees, compared with one when Obama took office, according to research carried out by Russell Wheeler, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. \nIn addition to appointing two Supreme Court justices and dozens of district court judges, Obama appointments now make up 55 of the current 168 appeals court judges, according to the judiciary. Obama’s current total of 323 district and appeals court appointments, most of them district court judges, is similar to the tallies achieved by other recent two-term presidents. \nThe regional appeals courts are currently more powerful than ever because of the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, which has left the court divided equally between liberals and conservatives. If the ideologically divided court splits 4-4, the appeals court ruling is left intact. Such an outcome occurred four times in the Supreme Court term that recently ended. \nScalia's seat is unlikely to be filled until next year due to political opposition from Republicans in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees. \nCOURTS TRANSFORMED \nOne of the most dramatic transformations has been on the 4th Circuit. \nIn July 2007, 18 months before Obama became president, Republican appointees held a 7-5 majority. Through a mix of seven Obama appointments and retirements, Democratic appointees now hold sway. \nIn April, a three-judge panel featuring two Obama appointees ruled in favor of a transgender student seeking to use a boys' restroom. The two Obama appointees were in the majority, with a Republican appointee dissenting. \nThree months later, a three-judge panel featuring two Obama appointees and one judge appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton struck down North Carolina's strict voter identification law on a 3-0 vote, saying the state legislature had enacted it with discriminatory intent. \nIt is one of several recent court rulings pushing back on Republican-led efforts to impose new voting regulations, which Democrats say is intended to deter minorities from voting. \nCaroline Fredrickson, president of liberal legal group the American Constitution Society, said Republican-appointed judges are generally less likely to rule in favor of broad interpretations of civil rights. The transgender case would \"very likely\" have come out differently with a more conservative panel of judges, she said. \nThe federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. is another where the balance of power has been flipped. Often known in legal circles as the second highest court in the land because it hears important cases concerning the federal government, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was dominated by conservatives 6-3 when Obama took office. \nObama was able to force through four appointments after a major showdown in the Senate. The court now has a 7-4 split in favor of Democratic appointees. \nIn June, an Obama appointee, Judge Sri Srinivasan, cast the deciding vote as a three-judge panel upheld the Federal Communication Commission's so-called \"net neutrality\" regulation. Srinivasan joined a Clinton appointee in the majority. A judge appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan dissented. The regulation is widely opposed by the telecommunications industry and backed by digital rights advocates. \nObama’s appointees do sometimes vote in favor of conservative outcomes. Paul Watford, a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has on several occasions reached a different conclusion to his more liberal colleagues. In one recent decision from Aug. 15, he dissented along with conservative judges when the court ruled that a death row inmate should be able to file a new appeal. \nWhen announcing three of his nominees to the appeals court in Washington at a White House press conference in June 2013, Obama rejected any notion that they were political pawns, emphasizing their strong credentials. \n\"These are no slouches. These are no hacks,\" he said. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; editing by Stuart Grudgings.) Trending Stories",

	      "text": "  WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says that President Barack Obama will expand a national monument off the coast of Hawaii, creating the world’s largest marine protected area. Obama’s proclamation will quadruple in size a monument originally created by President George W. Bush in 2006. The Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument will contain some 582,578 square miles, more than twice the size of Texas. Obama will travel to the monument next week to mark the designation and cite the need to protect public lands and waters from climate change. The designation bans commercial fishing and any new mining, as is the case within the existing monument. Recreational fishing will be allowed through a permit, as will be scientific research and the removal of fish and other resources for Native Hawaiian cultural practices. Some fishing groups have voiced concerns about what an expansion of the marine national monument would mean for their industry. Sean Martin, the president of the Hawaii Longline Association, said he was “disappointed” by Hawaii Gov. David Ige’s decision to support expanding the monument. He said the monument’s expansion would be based on political and not scientific reasons. Hawaii’s longline fishing fleet supplies a large portion of the fresh tuna and other fish consumed in Hawaii. Martin has previously estimated the fleet catches about 2 million pounds of fish annually from the proposed expansion area. The White House is describing the expansion as helping to protect more than 7,000 species and improving the resiliency of an ecosystem dealing with ocean acidification and warming. A fact sheet previewing the announcement states that the expanded area is considered a sacred place for Native Hawaiians. Shipwrecks and downed aircraft from the Battle of Midway in World War II dot the expansion area. The battle marked a major shift in the war. Obama will travel to the Midway Atoll to discuss the expansion. With the announcement, Obama will have created or expanded 26 national monuments. The administration said Obama has protected more acreage through national monument designations than any other president. The White House said the expansion is a response to a proposal from Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and prominent Native Hawaiian leaders. The federal government will also give Hawaii’s Department of Natural Resources and Office of Hawaiian Affairs a greater role in managing the monument, an arrangement requested by Schatz and Gov. David Ige. Share This:",

JUST WATCHED Inside the new monument to the fight for women's rights 02:42 Story highlights Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Women's Equality Day The Equal Rights Amendment has been presented to Congress since 1923 The ERA has never been ratified (CNN) Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Women's Equality Day, designated in 1971 to commemorate the 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. But voting was only the beginning for some women's rights advocates, who pivoted in the 1920s to the larger issue of enshrining equal rights in the Constitution. Penned by Alice Paul, the Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 by Rep. Daniel R. Anthony, nephew of women's suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony. Anthony's 1923 proposal didn't pass. In fact, it was very polarizing, even among women. Eleanor Roosevelt, for instance, opposed the ERA for many years. One of the major objections at the time was questioning how the ERA would impact protective labor legislation, rules that guarded against issues like unfair hours or dangerous work conditions for women. \"If you have an amendment that says men and women are completely equal under the eyes of the law, what does that do to those protections that have then been instilled specifically based on gender?\" Jennifer Krafchik, deputy director of the National Woman's Party, explained to CNN. 11,000 failed attempts to change America The ERA was introduced in the next 49 consecutive sessions of Congress until 1972, when it passed and was sent to the states for ratification. It fell three states short in 1982. It was most recently introduced to both chambers of Congress in May 2015. Read More The woman responsible for reintroducing the ERA to the House last year was New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. \"Almost 100 years after women were granted the right to vote, it is past time to enshrine full equality for all in the Constitution and ratify the ERA,\" Maloney said in a written statement to CNN. The history of the ERA is one of the major focal points at the newly minted Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument . Formerly known as the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum, President Barack Obama designated the site earlier this year as part of an initiative to celebrate women's history at national park sites. The National Park Service and National Woman's Party now partner to educate visitors from around the world on the history of women's rights in the United States. Visitors are able to see items from the National Woman's Party collection, which holds thousands of items from their effort, including congressional voting cards , an ink-and-paper database detailing information on the congressmen and senators the NWP lobbied on issues like suffrage and the ERA.

The interviewer writes that, despite opposition, he \"may be even amenable if carefully handled.\" Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1928 National Woman's Party congressional voting card on a meeting with South Carolina Democrat Fred Dominick notes he opposes the Equal Rights Amendment, saying, \"The normal woman knows her place.\" Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1924 National Woman's Party congressional voting card notes Rep. John Morrow's support for the Equal Rights Amendment. \"I feel this is an obvious step and that women should be admitted into full participation with men in every field,\" he says. Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment Republican J. Banks Kurtz of Pennsylvania, who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, tells his interviewer in 1928, \"If this amendment were passed, you could say, 'Now, we had a man president of the US last year; in order for things to be equal, we must have a woman president next year.'\" Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1930 National Woman's Party congressional voting card notes John Box's support of the Equal Rights Amendment. He pledges his support, with his interviewer noting Box \"thinks his daughter should have every right which his son has.\" Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1928 National Woman's Party congressional voting card indicates a meeting with Republican John Tilson of Connecticut didn't go well. Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1923 National Woman's Party congressional voting card outlines a meeting with Republican Frank Crowther of New York. Crowther says he would support the Equal Rights Amendment if it didn't interfere with rights already granted to women, particularly regarding protective labor legislation. Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment In this undated National Woman's Party congressional voting card, the interviewer writes that amendment supporter Republican Rep. Charles Kading of Wisconsin \"does not know of any department in Washington where women haven't equaled or excelled men.\" Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1924 National Woman's Party congressional voting card documents a meeting with Morton Hull of Illinois. Hull doesn't commit on the Equal Rights Amendment but says he supports women's rights. \"My wife has it 60/50 now,\" he tells his interviewer. Hide Caption 9 of 9 The fight for the ERA today is very different than it was 90 years ago. \"The concerns that existed so many years ago are not as much of a concern today,\" Krafchik said. \"However, there are some very hot-button issues that cause concern for opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. One of those is abortion. One of those continues to be women in military service, although we are rapidly chipping away at that.\" Another ongoing issue that has gained traction this election cycle is the pay gap. Regardless of personal beliefs about the need for the ERA, the Belmont-Paul staff emphasizes education on the issue. \"Some people believe that women are already guaranteed equal rights in the Constitution, based on the 14th Amendment,\" Krafchik said, explaining a common misconception. \"Whether you support the ERA or don't support the ERA, understanding where we've come from, where we still have to go and the rights that we're still fighting for is an important message for us.\" Sections ",

	      "text": "By Jeff Mason WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Barack Obama became the first African-American to win the White House in 2008, his victory was a turning point in U.S. race relations that set high expectations for progress to come.\nNearly eight years later, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton attacking each other over racial politics, the legacy of Obama's presidency looks decidedly mixed, black leaders said.\nTo some, the tone of the Republican presidential nominee's campaign, as well as a recent series of racially charged shootings involving police, show that the United States has come no closer to overcoming its history of racial strife.\nHaving a black president, two attorneys general and a chief of homeland security did not result in basic fairness for victims of racially charged violence, said Cornel West, an academic and former Obama supporter who has become a high-profile critic of the Democratic president.\n\"How many policemen who have murdered unarmed innocent black civilians have gone to jail with that kind of black power at the top? Zero,\" West said.\nObama could have acted more directly while in office to help blacks, West added, citing persistently high childhood poverty among African-Americans. “The (economic) recovery has not filtered over into black and working poor communities,” he said.\nOthers said Obama showed leadership on race while making real achievements on healthcare and the economy that helped Americans of all ethnicities.\nAl Sharpton, a civil rights leader with close ties to the White House, described Obama as a \"transformative\" president held back by the need to serve varying constituencies and compromise with lawmakers who had different priorities.\n\"He tried to be as balanced and respectful as he could, to the chagrin of many in the black community, who felt that he was leaning over backwards,” Sharpton said.\nUnemployment among African-Americans fell by half under Obama, Sharpton noted, while Obama's remarks on race elevated the issue. In 2012 at the White House, Obama referred to Trayvon Martin, a black youth gunned down by a white Hispanic man, as a boy who would have resembled the son he did not have.\n“We’ve never had a president do that,” Sharpton said.\nFALSE SENSE OF PROGRESS\nAndrew Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and adviser to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., said Obama, as a black leader, had to seek compromise more than previous white presidents.\n\"It was easier for (Jimmy) Carter or Lyndon Johnson, even Bill Clinton as southern whites to do things specifically for black people,\" Young said.\nBacklash from white working class voters had contributed to Trump's rise, Young said.\n\"We really haven’t had a complete psychological adjustment to a multi-racial society,\" he said. \"That’s what’s rallying people behind Trump. They're frustrated by the complexities of this day and age. And (Trump), like others, gives a simple answer and blames it on somebody else.\"\nClinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, blasted Trump on Thursday as a divisive candidate who was stoking racist groups. Trump criticized Clinton, saying she had let black Americans down and was falsely labeling Republicans as bigoted.\nClinton supporters were more likely to want to address race relations than Trump supporters, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll of more than 2,800 people found in late March.\nObama has said race relations are not as bad as some suggest. Friends say he never expected his presidency to wipe away centuries of racism and slavery's legacy.\n\"To expect to erase all of that legacy of injustice or racism and discrimination in eight years is unrealistic,\" said Valerie Jarrett, a White House adviser and close Obama friend.\n\"Were there people who probably had a false sense of progress based just on an election? Sure,\" she said.\nThe administration wants to advance criminal justice reform legislation before Obama leaves office, aiming for a win on an issue watched closely in the black community. But prospects of passage in Congress during an election year are uncertain.\nObama, who has made clear his disdain for Trump and his frustration with Congress, has said he hoped his own voice on race would help improve things for future generations. \"We plant seeds, and somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted,\" Obama said at a news conference in July.\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh)",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Friday expanded a national monument off the coast of Hawaii, creating a safe zone for tuna, sea turtles and thousands of other species in what will be the world's largest marine protected area. Obama's proclamation quadrupled in size a monument originally created by President George W. Bush in 2006. The Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument will contain some 582,578 square miles, more than twice the size of Texas.\nThe president is slated to travel to the monument next week to mark the new designation and cite the need to protect public lands and waters from climate change. The president was born in Hawaii and spent much of his childhood there.\nIn creating the new monument, Obama cited its \"diverse ecological communities\" as well as \"great cultural significance to the Native Hawaiian community and a connection to early Polynesian culture worthy of protection and understanding.\"\nThe monument designation bans commercial fishing and any new mining, as is the case within the existing monument. Recreational fishing will be allowed through a permit, as will be scientific research and the removal of fish and other resources for Native Hawaiian cultural practices.\nThe regional council that manages U.S. waters in the Pacific Islands voiced disappointment with Obama's decision, saying it \"serves a political legacy\" rather than a conservation benefit.\nThe council recommends catch limits and other steps designed to sustain fisheries. It said it recommended other expansion options that would have minimized impacts to the Hawaii longline fishery, which supplies a large portion of the fresh tuna and other fish consumed in Hawaii.\n\"Closing 60 percent of Hawaii's waters to commercial fishing, when science is telling us that it will not lead to more productive local fisheries, makes no sense,\" said Edwin Ebiusi Jr., chairman of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council \"Today is a sad day in the history of Hawaii's fisheries and a negative blow to our local food security.\"\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts helped lead the push to expand the monument. It says research shows that very large, fully protected marine reserves are necessary to rebuild fish populations and diversity of species.\n\"By expanding the monument, President Obama has increased protections for one of the most biologically and culturally significant places on the planet\" said Joshua S. Reichert, an executive vice president at Pew.\nThe White House is describing the expansion as helping to protect more than 7,000 species and improving the resiliency of an ecosystem dealing with ocean acidification and warming. It also is emphasizing that the expanded area is considered a sacred place for Native Hawaiians.\nShipwrecks and downed aircraft from the Battle of Midway in World War II dot the expansion area. The battle marked a major shift in the war. Obama will travel to the Midway Atoll to discuss the expansion.\nWith the announcement, Obama will have created or expanded 26 national monuments. The administration said Obama has protected more acreage through national monument designations than any other president.\nThe White House said the expansion is a response to a proposal from Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz and prominent Native Hawaiian leaders. The federal government will also give Hawaii's Department of Natural Resources and Office of Hawaiian Affairs a greater role in managing the monument, an arrangement requested by Schatz and Gov. David Ige.",

	      "text": "  4:22pm EDT U.S. seeks to soothe Turkey ties, press fight against Islamic State Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan meets with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey. Kayhan Ozer/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS By Patrick Markey | ISTANBUL \nISTANBUL The last time U.S. Vice President Joe Biden flew to Turkey, in January, he had a stern message for President Tayyip Erdogan: his model of Islamic democracy was setting a bad example by intimidating media and threatening academics. \nBut his tone was markedly different when he arrived in Ankara on Wednesday, weeks after a failed coup in Turkey that has strained relations between the two countries, and he appeared to be in diplomatic damage-limitation mode. \nTurkish officials have been incensed by the concerns expressed by Washington and European capitals about Ankara's subsequent crackdown on suspected plotters, but what they perceive as indifference to the coup attempt itself. \nA weakening of the U.S.-Turkish alliance is a concern for the United States, which is counting on support from Turkey - which has NATO's second-biggest military - in the battle against Islamic State. \nAmerican worries may have been compounded by Erdogan restoring ties with Russia and even discussing military cooperation with President Vladimir Putin. \nMeeting with Erdogan and Turkey's prime minister in Ankara on Wednesday, Biden delivered a message of alliance and conciliation. \n\"Let me say it for one last time: The American people stand with you ... Barack Obama was one of the first people you called. But I do apologize. I wish I could have been here earlier,\" Biden said. \nHe said U.S. officials would cooperate in investigating evidence against Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric Erdogan has blamed for masterminding the coup bid with his followers. \nErdogan has demanded that Washington hand over Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the coup, but U.S. authorities have said Turkey must first provide evidence of his wrongdoing. \nSYRIAN OFFENSIVE \nHours before Biden arrived, in a timely illustration of the role Turkey plays in the fight against Islamic State, Turkish forces backed by U.S.-led coalition jets launched a major push across the border into northern Syria to drive the jihadist group out of the frontier town of Jarablus. \nFormer Supreme Allied Commander at NATO, Admiral James Stavridis, said the key to U.S. ties with Turkey was balancing realist and idealist tensions, between the need for a strong, regional NATO ally and drawing attention to human rights. \n\"The vice president's visit is an effort to find the right setting on the dial, and will somewhat disappoint those who want a more black-and-white stance on human rights,\" said Stavridis, now dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts. \n\"But given the huge geopolitical issues at play, my sense is he hit the right notes.\" \nSince the attempted coup - in which more than 240 people were killed - Turkish authorities have dismissed or suspended tens of thousands of military personnel, civil servants and judges suspected of ties to Gulen's network. Around 40,000 people have been formally arrested for links to the coup. \nTurkey's ties with the European Union have also been strained by the reaction to the government crackdown. EU officials, like Washington, have expressed concerns about the scale of the purge and urged Ankara to uphold the rule of law. \nThe rift has increased tensions over an EU deal with Turkey to help tackle Europe's migrant crisis - the other powerful piece of leverage Erdogan holds with the West. \nAnkara has warned that Turkey could walk away from its promise to stem the flow of illegal migrants to Europe if the European Union fails to grant Turks visa-free travel in October. \nEuropean officials have in the past often chided Erdogan for what his opponents say is creeping authoritarianism and an intolerance of dissent, including the jailing of critical journalists - charges denied by the Turkish leader. \nBut those who have visited Turkey over the past two weeks have, like Biden, taken a more conciliatory tone. \nCOMPLEX RELATIONS \nEven before the diplomatic tensions in the aftermath of the coup, U.S.-Turkish relations were complex and sensitive. \nThe two NATO members work together against Islamic State in Syria. However Turkey backs Syrian rebels in a drive to oust the jihadist group, but also to halt the advance of a U.S.-backed force of mainly Kurdish fighters who Ankara views as allies of Kurdish insurgents on its own soil. \nThe dual nature of Turkey's security concerns in neighboring Syria was underlined by its U.S.-backed incursion this week, which it said was as much about stopping Kurdish militia seizing territory as it was about eliminating Islamic State. \nOne U.S. official said Biden's trip was in part to correct the impression among some Turks that Washington somehow endorsed the attempted coup, and also make clear the U.S. government understands the trauma of the putsch for Turkey. \n\"The vice president's empathy was genuine and important for the people of Turkey to hear. At a time of great uncertainty, it is important to remind friends you have their back,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nBiden visited the parliament building in Ankara bombed during the coup by rogue pilots in commandeered jets, expressing dismay at the loss of life. \nErdogan acknowledged the importance of the alliance between Turkey and the United States and welcomed Biden's message of solidarity. But he dismissed the vice-president's comments that a U.S. federal court must decide whether Gulen should be sent to Turkey, instead demanding the cleric be handed over immediately. \n\"What an opportunity he and the U.S. administration wasted,\" Daily Sabah, pro-government newspaper wrote in an editorial this week. \"Did he take this long trip to Turkey merely to say 'It's in the hand of the courts'? Couldn't a simple intern in his office have conveyed the same message without creating all this fuss?\" \n(Additional reporting by Jeff Mason and Cagan Uslu; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Pravin Char) Trending Stories",

REUTERS/Larry Downing/File Photo By Dave McKinney | CHICAGO \nCHICAGO Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner urged lawmakers on Friday to allow voters in 2018 to decide whether to change how political boundaries are drawn after the state's Supreme Court a day earlier declared a petition-driven redistricting initiative for this fall's statewide ballot unconstitutional. \nRauner called Illinois' existing political maps, which are drawn by Democrats who control the General Assembly, \"rigged and gerrymandered\" because they have left a majority of legislative races this fall without challengers to incumbent legislators. \n\"Our system of government is broken,\" Rauner told reporters during a stop in Marion, in far southern Illinois. \"Two-thirds of our general elections don't have opponents, and we've got to change the system.\" \nThe next opportunity for state legislators to put a constitutional amendment before voters comes in two years, when the first-term governor is expected to be in the midst of a re-election campaign. \n\"Our system has been run by a broken, powerful political machine in Chicago that looks out for itself, not for the people of Illinois, and certainly not for the people of southern Illinois,\" Rauner said. \"We've got to get the power away from that machine, and we can do it with political reform.\" \nRauner's comments came less than 24 hours after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to uphold a lower court ruling that would keep in place the once-a-decade, partisan-controlled political mapmaking process that has allowed for Democratic majorities in the state legislature and on the elected Supreme Court. \nThe amendment, if it was placed on November's ballot and passed by a majority of Illinois voters, would have transferred the power of re-drawing legislative districts to a bipartisan commission. More than 563,000 Illinois voters signed petitions backing the amendment. \nThere were 12 redistricting amendments filed in both chambers during the current legislative session though none won approval in both chambers. \nThe Illinois Supreme Court ruled the ballot initiative fell outside the scope of permissible ballot initiatives, which may only be used for amendments directed at \"structural and procedural subjects\" in the constitution pertaining to Illinois's legislative branch. \nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Robert Thomas wrote: \"Today a muzzle has been placed on the people of this State, and their voices supplanted by judicial fiat.\" \n(Reporting by Dave McKinney in Chicago; Additional reporting by Kim Palmer in Cleveland, Ohio, and Eric M.

	      "text": "Story highlights Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Women's Equality Day The Equal Rights Amendment has been presented to Congress since 1923 The ERA has never been ratified\n(CNN) Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Women's Equality Day, designated in 1971 to commemorate the 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.\nBut voting was only the beginning for some women's rights advocates, who pivoted in the 1920s to the larger issue of enshrining equal rights in the Constitution. Penned by Alice Paul, the Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 by Rep. Daniel R. Anthony, nephew of women's suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony. Anthony's 1923 proposal didn't pass. In fact, it was very polarizing, even among women. Eleanor Roosevelt, for instance, opposed the ERA for many years. One of the major objections at the time was questioning how the ERA would impact protective labor legislation, rules that guarded against issues like unfair hours or dangerous work conditions for women. \"If you have an amendment that says men and women are completely equal under the eyes of the law, what does that do to those protections that have then been instilled specifically based on gender?\" Jennifer Krafchik, deputy director of the National Woman's Party, explained to CNN. 11,000 failed attempts to change America The ERA was introduced in the next 49 consecutive sessions of Congress until 1972, when it passed and was sent to the states for ratification. It fell three states short in 1982. It was most recently introduced to both chambers of Congress in May 2015. Read More The woman responsible for reintroducing the ERA to the House last year was New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. \"Almost 100 years after women were granted the right to vote, it is past time to enshrine full equality for all in the Constitution and ratify the ERA,\" Maloney said in a written statement to CNN. The history of the ERA is one of the major focal points at the newly minted Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument . Formerly known as the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum, President Barack Obama designated the site earlier this year as part of an initiative to celebrate women's history at national park sites. The National Park Service and National Woman's Party now partner to educate visitors from around the world on the history of women's rights in the United States. Visitors are able to see items from the National Woman's Party collection, which holds thousands of items from their effort, including congressional voting cards , an ink-and-paper database detailing information on the congressmen and senators the NWP lobbied on issues like suffrage and the ERA.

Banks Kurtz of Pennsylvania, who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, tells his interviewer in 1928, \"If this amendment were passed, you could say, 'Now, we had a man president of the US last year; in order for things to be equal, we must have a woman president next year.'\" Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment This 1930 National Woman's Party congressional voting card notes John Box's support of the Equal Rights Amendment.

Hull doesn't commit on the Equal Rights Amendment but says he supports women's rights. \"My wife has it 60/50 now,\" he tells his interviewer. Hide Caption 9 of 9 The fight for the ERA today is very different than it was 90 years ago. \"The concerns that existed so many years ago are not as much of a concern today,\" Krafchik said. \"However, there are some very hot-button issues that cause concern for opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. One of those is abortion. One of those continues to be women in military service, although we are rapidly chipping away at that.\" Another ongoing issue that has gained traction this election cycle is the pay gap. Regardless of personal beliefs about the need for the ERA, the Belmont-Paul staff emphasizes education on the issue. \"Some people believe that women are already guaranteed equal rights in the Constitution, based on the 14th Amendment,\" Krafchik said, explaining a common misconception. \"Whether you support the ERA or don't support the ERA, understanding where we've come from, where we still have to go and the rights that we're still fighting for is an important message for us.\"",

	      "text": "Katherine Johnson lo contaba todo: sus pasos, los escalones de la iglesia, el número de platos y cubiertos que fregaba, todo. Esa pasión por los números pudo haberse desvanecido como una memoria de la infancia. Pero su padre insistió en que debía continuar sus estudios. Una niña negra estadounidense necesitaba una férrea determinación para ascender por encima de los límites impuestos por la segregación racial.\nVer fotos\nKatherine Johnson en 1971, dos años después de haber contribuido a una de las grandes hazañas del programa espacial estadounidense (NASA)\nJohnson nació en 1918 en White Sulfur Springs, un poblado de menos de 1.000 habitantes en Virginia Occidental. Joshua, su padre, no dudó en mudar a su familia a 200 kilómetros para que sus hijos pudieran asistir al Instituto. El joven agricultor, que no había terminado el sexto grado, creía en la importancia de la educación y en la igualdad de oportunidades para todos sin importar el color de la piel. En aquella época los colegios para negros normalmente solo ofrecían clases hasta octavo grado.\nPronto los profesores descubrieron el talento extraordinario de Johnson para las matemáticas. Uno de ellos, el reconocido matemático afronorteamericano William W. Schieffelin Claytor, le sugirió que se dedicara a la investigación en ese campo. Ella no sabía exactamente en qué consistiría esa carrera o si encontraría un empleo. Sin embargo, su camino ya estaba trazado.\nA los 18 años obtuvo su licenciatura con honores en matemática y francés en el West Virginia State College. Ese diploma le facilitó un contrato como profesora. Nada más. Y así transcurrió la vida durante casi dos décadas, entre el matrimonio, la familia, las clases… Hasta un día, durante las vacaciones de 1952, Johnson se enteró de que el Comité Consejero Nacional para la Aeronáutica (NACA, antecesor de la agencia aeroespacial NASA) buscaba “mujeres computadoras”, como las llamaban entonces. El destino la hacía una señal.\nVer fotos\nAl principio de su carrera Johnson realizaba los cálculos que años después se asignarían a máquinas computadoras (NASA)\nLa mujer que hacía preguntas Johnson entró en el equipo de mujeres negras que trabajaban como “computadoras humanas”. Apartadas de sus colegas blancas, estas expertas en cálculos debían usar baños separados, sentarse en mesas diferentes en la cafetería y descansar no en un dormitorio, sino buscar alojamiento en las afueras de las instalaciones del NACA en Hampton, Virginia.\nLeer más La talentosa matemática se distinguió rápidamente de sus compañeras por una costumbre inhabitual: hacer preguntas. Su interés por ir más allá de las tareas asignadas sorprendió a los ingenieros, que la incorporaron como la única mujer en el programa más tarde conocido como Space Task Force. La misión de este equipo era enviar a un estadounidense al espacio. La carrera contra la Unión Soviética obligaba.\nLos cálculos manuales de Johnson sustentaron la trayectoria de Alan Shepard, el primer norteamericano en viajar al espacio exterior, en 1961. Un año después, cuando el astronauta John Glenn se preparaba para orbitar la Tierra, este pidió a la experta que comprobara la exactitud de los cálculos realizados por las primeras máquinas computadoras usadas por la NASA.\nEl 20 de julio de 1969, cuando Neil Amstrong se convirtió en el primer ser humano en pisar la superficie de la Luna, Johnson observaba la hazaña por la televisión. Nerviosa, pero segura de la exactitud de sus cálculos. Detrás del “gran salto para la humanidad”, el trabajo riguroso de una discreta mujer negra. Un año después ayudó a traer de vuelta a los tripulantes de la abortada misión Apolo 13.\nDurante 33 años la apasionada de los números asistió feliz a su puesto en la NASA. En 2015, Barack Obama la reconoció con la Medalla Presidencial de la Libertad, el mayor honor que concede Estados Unidos a los civiles.\nVer fotos\nJohnson ha dedicado su vida a estimular a otros que como ella sueñan con una carrera en el mundo de las ciencias (NASA)\nUna carrera inspiradora La vida de Katherine Johnson, que será adaptada al cine por la película Hidden Figures (estreno en enero de 2017), debería inspirar a millones de mujeres dentro y fuera de Estados Unidos. Ella no solo superó los obstáculos impuestos por el racismo, sino también el menosprecio a las capacidades femeninas en un campo del conocimiento tradicionalmente reservado a los hombres.\nLas estadounidenses ocupan menos de un tercio de los empleos en ciencias de la computación y apenas el 14 por ciento en las ingenierías, aunque representan casi la mitad de la fuerza laboral.\nEllas aprenden desde niñas que las matemáticas y las ciencias son áreas reservadas para los varones. Los modelos de éxito para las chicas ascienden más bien de las humanidades, la medicina y las artes. El sexismo, los estereotipos, la dificultad para mantener el equilibrio entre la profesión y las exigencias de la maternidad… se levantan frente a aquellas que intentan abrirse paso.",

	      "text": "Terry Root often goes to sleep at night wondering how she’ll be able to get up the next morning and do it all over again. Then the sun comes up and she forces herself out of bed. She might go for a run to release the pent-up anxiety. Sometimes she cries. Or she’ll commiserate with colleagues, sharing in and validating each other’s angst. What keeps Terry up at night aren’t the usual ailments; it’s not a tyrant boss or broken heart.\nThe diagnosis: global warming .\nA senior fellow at Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment, Root has spent the past two decades unraveling the thread between climate change and the eventual mass extinctions of countless species of plants, animals — and, yes, humans. “That’s a tough, tough thing to cope with,” Root says in a weary, jagged voice. There’s more. When the gray-haired bird watcher shares her End of Days findings, she’s often met with personal attacks; naysayers hurl their disagreement and disdain, complete with name-calling and threats from politicians. But the absolute worst part of her job? We’re not listening. “It’s harder than hell to carry that,” says Root.\nView photos\nWindhover 129 More\nStanford University built a non-secular spiritual center on campus called Windhover, where students and faculty can go to meditate and reflect. It opened last year.\nSource Matthew Millman\nArmageddon aside for a moment, that an acclaimed scientist will say h-e-l-l to a reporter and use words like cope is a sign of changing times. Not only are we living on a warming planet but a progressively emotive one . It started with parents coddling their kids (no more advice to “just suck it up”), then it was emojis (punctuation isn’t enough) and now it’s climatologists tweeting “we’re f’d” and field researchers speaking up about climate depression — or even pre traumatic stress disorder.\nThere is a paradigm shift taking place in the field of science with the recognition that even the most stoic minds of the world need a way to process their doomsday findings. All of this is fueling a debate that’s raged since before Galileo and until recently landed on one central question: What place does human emotion have in scientific reasoning? But in 2015, there’s another layer that’s been schlepped into the controversial heap: What do you do when your job is to document the end of the world?\n***\nFor centuries, professors say, the scientific fraternity has adhered to a “hidden curriculum” — right there, in invisible block letters, beneath the sign saying Goggles must be worn at all times . No. Crying. In. Science. And for good reason, many argue. In this world of double-blind trials and peer-reviewed articles, objectivity rules all. Otherwise cracks open up and doubt seeps in, rotting the very foundation science is built upon.\nBut what if the entire goddamned profession gets wiped out in a hurricane? Then what? There’s a growing sense of urgency as worsening environmental catastrophes play out before us. In the midst of what many in the science community — by “many,” we mean upward of 95 percent — are calling a planetary crisis , more researchers are finding that they can’t simply present their data in a vacuum, then go home at the end of the day and crack open a beer. “Scientists are going from these totally objective outsiders into being much more subjective and a part of the community,” says Faith Kearns, an outreach coordinator for the California Institute for Water Resources, which tries to solve drought-related challenges.\nIndeed, the façade of total objectivity has deteriorated in recent years alongside intensifying environmental cataclysms. In 2012, Camille Parmesan, who shared a Nobel Prize with Al Gore in 2007 for her climate work, publicly announced her professional depression and frustration with the current political stalemate. Shortly after The Atlantic named Parmesan one of its 27 “Brave Thinkers,” alongside Steve Jobs and Barack Obama, for her efforts to save species, she temporarily left her university job in Texas for a reprieve across the pond. Then last summer, climatologist Jason Box’s tweet — “If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we’re f’d” — went viral, provoking a media frenzy. The public relentlessly chastised him for a) making a definitive statement instead of dealing in the usual probabilities and b) expressing emotion.\nAnd now there’s the website Is This How You Feel? , which publishes handwritten letters from climate scientists expressing their frustrations, fears and hopes. One professor writes, “It’s probably the first time I have ever been asked to say what I feel rather than what I think.” Another scrawls, “I feel exasperation and despair. … I feel vulnerable that by writing this letter I will expose myself to trolling and vitriol.” Joe Duggan, the mohawked Aussie with a nose ring and master’s degree in the growing field of science communications who manages the site, says he’s been shocked at how many responses he’s gotten in the mail: “There is a movement of scientists looking for new ways to connect; they’re emoting in ways they never have before,” he says.\n***\nView photos\nWindhover 130 More\nStanford’s Windhover integrates nature throughout the center to help visitors re-connect with and replenish their spirits.\nSource Matthew Millman\nElizabeth Allison turns off the lights. She instructs her students to stack one vertebra on top of the next until their spines are straight and long. Then to focus on the rhythm of their breath. In. And out. In. And out. Acknowledge any feelings or sensations that arise, then let them go. After 15 minutes she slowly guides them back into the present. Feet and hands begin to stir. Eyelids slowly make their way to full attention.\nOK, that’s it. See you all next week — and don’t forget your homework assignment is due. After all, this is graduate-level course PAR 6079.\nSo much for that centuries-old hidden curriculum. From professors like Allison taking students through a guided meditation after a discussion on retreating rainforests to scientists signing up for workshops on compassion and communication to support groups for climatologists, human emotion has wedged itself into every step of the scientific method. Marilyn Cornelius, a Stanford-trained researcher, has found the best way to explore creative solutions for the planet’s woes is to meld behavioral science, biomimicry, meditation and design thinking. Now she works as a consultant, taking energy experts on wilderness retreats and teaching lab coats to connect with themselves and nature. “I made a decision to work on behavior change,” Cornelius says, “because it’s a positive way to work on the climate problem.”\nThis isn’t just about managing the feelings of scientists, though. Kearns, from the California Institute for Water Resources, acknowledges how painful it can be to watch academics try to relate to everyday folks and has made it her mission to make these interactions less cringe-inducing. The soft-spoken brunette first began thinking about this impasse after some years back she hosted a community workshop on emerging “stay or go” science that weighs whether home owners can — and should — protect their property from increasingly frequent and ferocious wildfires. Her audience was a small northern California community that had recently faced that very dilemma. Fear, anger and helplessness pulsed through the room. “I started to feel their anxiety,” Kearns says. “Our research has an effect on people’s lives. My scientific training hadn’t prepared me to cope with the emotions that come with that.”\nBut there is still the camp that believes feelings erode credibility and breed bias. It’s the naturalistic fallacy, and it’s the difference between the is and the ought . The philosophy is that facts can’t substantiate value judgments. Science is perhaps the last frontier of neutrality, especially in today’s polarized society. As Philip Handler, former president of the National Academy of Sciences, once said, scientists “best serve public policy by living within the ethics of science, not those of politics.”\n***\nView photos\nWindhover 128 More\nWindhover is named after Nathan Oliveira’s renowned series of paintings that were ”inspired by kestrels swooping above the Stanford foothills,” according to the website.\nSource Matthew Millman\nThe seismic sentimental shift among scientists parallels an outpouring of feeling — and narcissism — across American society. Once-detached psychotherapists are hugging their clients, journalists have come to love the personal essay (in fact, it seems like everyone has a story to tell these days), even man-eating corporations are experimenting with emotional leadership. Or think of the impassioned protests around Black Lives Matter, the outrage at sexual abuse and the pleas against social inequality. “There’s been more space in the public realm for bringing up and dealing with emotional stuff, and that has cracked the shell of otherwise very removed scientists,” says Allison, a professor at the California Institute for Integral Studies. Then again, maybe climatologists are more cunning than we give them credit for, and they’re simply taking a page out of their opponents’ playbook.\nIndeed, emotions are a powerful tool for those who know how to use them. Which is why those leading the climate-change charge aren’t looking to labs anymore. Instead, eager students are following Cornelius’s path, pursuing studies in contemplative environmentalism or transformational ecology, which looks to shrinks, money and Facebook to protect the planet. With the future of everything at stake, what has traditionally separated science from sentiment is a lot less defined — and perhaps even irrelevant.\nBut emotions are less predictable than facts and figures. Root remembers giving a talk once at the University of Utah. Afterward a few students came up to ask questions; one young man had tears in his eyes. “Is it really this bad?” he pleaded. Root told him it’s worse. He went on to become an activist and was sent to prison for one of his illegal protests. Root has always felt responsible.\n“I’d always thought that facts and the truth would win out; then I realized that wasn’t the case,” Root says.\nRelated Articles\nThe New Treatments That Could Transform Speech Therapy Could Your Cranky Tweets Shape the Future of Health Care?

	      "text": "World News | Sat Aug 27, 2016 9:44pm EDT As Obama heads to Laos, signs of a tilt away from China U.S. President Barack Obama takes his jacket off as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S. after visiting the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, August 26, 2016. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas By Marius Zaharia | VIENTIANE \nVIENTIANE The secretive communist government of Laos, a country with a population of less than 7 million, rarely causes a ripple on the diplomatic circuit. And yet its sleepy capital will spring to life next week when global leaders arrive for an Asian summit. \nBarack Obama will be among them, making the last push of his presidency to 'rebalance' Washington's foreign policy toward Asia, a strategy widely seen as a response to China's economic and military muscle-flexing across the region. \nThe might of Laos' giant neighbor to the north is hard to miss in Vientiane: wealthy Chinese driving SUVs overtake tuk-tuks sputtering along the roads and Chinese-backed hotels sprout from noisy construction sites in one of Asia's most low-rise cities. \nBut diplomats say Obama could be pushing on an open door in Laos, thanks to a change of government there in April. \nThey say the country's new leaders appear ready to tilt away from Beijing and lean more closely toward another neighbor, Vietnam, whose dispute with China over the South China Sea has pushed it into a deepening alliance with the United States. \n\"The new government is more influenced by the Vietnamese than the Chinese,\" said a Western diplomat in Southeast Asia.\" \"It's never too late for a U.S. president to visit.\" \nObama will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit landlocked Laos, where the United States waged a \"secret war\" while fighting in Vietnam, dropping an estimated two million tonnes of bombs on the country. About 30 percent of the ordnance failed to explode, leaving a dangerous and costly legacy. \nLaos has strategic importance to both Vietnam and China. Vietnam has a long land border with Laos that gives it access to markets in Thailand and beyond. For China, Laos is a key gateway to Southeast Asia in its \"new Silk Road\" trade strategy. \nLaos, which is developing a series of hydro power plants along one of the world's longest rivers, the Mekong, aims to become \"the battery of Asia\" by selling power to its neighbors. \nSHIFTING POLICY \nIt is difficult to read policy in Laos because its leaders are so uncommunicative, but Western diplomats have detected some shifts. \nFirst, deputy Prime Minister Somsavat Lengsavad - who ran the steering panel for a $7 billion Chinese rail project - retired. The project is now believed to be on hold because Laos is unhappy with the terms of the deal. \nOfficials of Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith's new government, many of them educated in Vietnam, have visited Hanoi en masse in recent weeks, their first foreign trip. \nAt two of the past meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is currently chaired by Laos, Vientiane has taken a more nuanced stance on Beijing than neighboring Cambodia, which is increasingly seen as a Chinese satellite. \n\"The U.S. strategic interest in Laos is to see the country be able to exert a certain degree of strategic autonomy because you don't want ... (to) have something akin to the relationship between China and Cambodia,\" said Phuong Nguyen of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. \nA defense official in Washington did not comment on wider strategic issues but described Laos as \"an important partner.\" \nA China foreign ministry spokesman said \"we welcome any country, including those inside and outside this region, developing constructive relations, as long as these ties are really beneficial to regional peace, stability and prosperity.\" \nLONG-TERM BATTLE \nBeijing has invested around $1 billion annually in Laos in 2014 and 2015, a step up from the $4.5 billion invested historically before 2014, according to figures from China's Ministry of Commerce and state-run media. \nFor the United States, impoverished Laos is not a strong investment draw. \n\"In Laos, we bring 7-8 companies to the table compared with 30-40 companies that Vietnam brings. But China- that's a totally different ball game,\" said Anthony Nelson, director of the U.S.-ASEAN business council. \n\"So there's no coincidence that the countries with the lowest levels of development, Laos and Cambodia, are the most willing to advocate for China's position in international discussions.\" \nBut the Lao are closer culturally to Vietnam than they are to China. Their businesses use Lao language signs and mixed Lao-Vietnamese families incorporate local customs, while Lao-Chinese families tend to be isolated. \n\"We are a bit frustrated with (China). They create their own eco-system,\" a Lao businessman said. \n(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Idrees Ali, Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard.; Editing by John Chalmers and Bill Tarrant) Trending Stories ",

	      "text": "By Marius Zaharia | VIENTIANE VIENTIANE The secretive communist government of Laos, a country with a population of less than 7 million, rarely causes a ripple on the diplomatic circuit. And yet its sleepy capital will spring to life next week when global leaders arrive for an Asian summit.\nBarack Obama will be among them, making the last push of his presidency to 'rebalance' Washington's foreign policy towards Asia, a strategy widely seen as a response to China's economic and military muscle-flexing across the region.\nThe might of Laos' giant neighbour to the north is hard to miss in Vientiane: wealthy Chinese driving SUVs overtake tuk-tuks sputtering along the roads and Chinese-backed hotels sprout from noisy construction sites in one of Asia's most low-rise cities.\nBut diplomats say Obama could be pushing on an open door in Laos, thanks to a change of government there in April.\nThey say the country's new leaders appear ready to tilt away from Beijing and lean more closely towards another neighbour, Vietnam, whose dispute with China over the South China Sea has pushed it into a deepening alliance with the United States.\n\"The new government is more influenced by the Vietnamese than the Chinese,\" said a Western diplomat in Southeast Asia.\"\n\"It's never too late for a U.S. president to visit.\"\nObama will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit landlocked Laos, where the United States waged a \"secret war\" while fighting in Vietnam, dropping an estimated two million tonnes of bombs on the country. About 30 percent of the ordnance failed to explode, leaving a dangerous and costly legacy.\nLaos has strategic importance to both Vietnam and China. Vietnam has a long land border with Laos that gives it access to markets in Thailand and beyond. For China, Laos is a key gateway to Southeast Asia in its \"new Silk Road\" trade strategy.\nLaos, which is developing a series of hydropower plants along one of the world's longest rivers, the Mekong, aims to become \"the battery of Asia\" by selling power to its neighbours.\nSHIFTING POLICY\nIt is difficult to read policy in Laos because its leaders are so uncommunicative, but Western diplomats have detected some shifts.\nFirst, deputy Prime Minister Somsavat Lengsavad - who ran the steering panel for a $7 billion Chinese rail project - retired. The project is now believed to be on hold because Laos is unhappy with the terms of the deal.\nOfficials of Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith's new government, many of them educated in Vietnam, have visited Hanoi en masse in recent weeks, their first foreign trip.\nAt two of the past meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is currently chaired by Laos, Vientiane has taken a more nuanced stance on Beijing than neighbouring Cambodia, which is increasingly seen as a Chinese satellite.\n\"The U.S. strategic interest in Laos is to see the country be able to exert a certain degree of strategic autonomy because you don't want ... (to) have something akin to the relationship between China and Cambodia,\" said Phuong Nguyen of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.\nA defence official in Washington did not comment on wider strategic issues but described Laos as \"an important partner.\"\nA China foreign ministry spokesman said \"we welcome any country, including those inside and outside this region, developing constructive relations, as long as these ties are really beneficial to regional peace, stability and prosperity.\"\nLONG-TERM BATTLE\nBeijing has invested around $1 billion annually in Laos in 2014 and 2015, a step up from the $4.5 billion invested historically before 2014, according to figures from China's Ministry of Commerce and state-run media.\nFor the United States, impoverished Laos is not a strong investment draw.\n\"In Laos, we bring 7-8 companies to the table compared with 30-40 companies that Vietnam brings. But China- that's a totally different ball game,\" said Anthony Nelson, director of the U.S.-ASEAN business council.\n\"So there's no coincidence that the countries with the lowest levels of development, Laos and Cambodia, are the most willing to advocate for China's position in international discussions.\"\nBut the Lao are closer culturally to Vietnam than they are to China. Their businesses use Lao language signs and mixed Lao-Vietnamese families incorporate local customs, while Lao-Chinese families tend to be isolated.\n\"We are a bit frustrated with (China). They create their own eco-system,\" a Lao businessman said.\n(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Idrees Ali, Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard.; Editing by John Chalmers and Bill Tarrant)",

For China, Laos is a key gateway to Southeast Asia in its “new Silk Road” trade strategy. \nLaos, which is developing a series of hydro power plants along one of the world’s longest rivers, the Mekong, aims to become “the battery of Asia” by selling power to its neighbors. \nSHIFTING POLICY \nIt is difficult to read policy in Laos because its leaders are so uncommunicative, but Western diplomats have detected some shifts. \nFirst, deputy Prime Minister Somsavat Lengsavad – who ran the steering panel for a $7 billion Chinese rail project – retired. The project is now believed to be on hold because Laos is unhappy with the terms of the deal. \nOfficials of Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith’s new government, many of them educated in Vietnam, have visited Hanoi en masse in recent weeks, their first foreign trip. \nAt two of the past meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is currently chaired by Laos, Vientiane has taken a more nuanced stance on Beijing than neighboring Cambodia, which is increasingly seen as a Chinese satellite. \n“The U.S. strategic interest in Laos is to see the country be able to exert a certain degree of strategic autonomy because you don’t want … (to) have something akin to the relationship between China and Cambodia,” said Phuong Nguyen of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. \nA defense official in Washington did not comment on wider strategic issues but described Laos as “an important partner.” \nA China foreign ministry spokesman said “we welcome any country, including those inside and outside this region, developing constructive relations, as long as these ties are really beneficial to regional peace, stability and prosperity.” \nLONG-TERM BATTLE \nBeijing has invested around $1 billion annually in Laos in 2014 and 2015, a step up from the $4.5 billion invested historically before 2014, according to figures from China’s Ministry of Commerce and state-run media. \nFor the United States, impoverished Laos is not a strong investment draw. \n“In Laos, we bring 7-8 companies to the table compared with 30-40 companies that Vietnam brings. But China- that’s a totally different ball game,” said Anthony Nelson, director of the U.S.-ASEAN business council. \n“So there’s no coincidence that the countries with the lowest levels of development, Laos and Cambodia, are the most willing to advocate for China’s position in international discussions.” \nBut the Lao are closer culturally to Vietnam than they are to China. Their businesses use Lao language signs and mixed Lao-Vietnamese families incorporate local customs, while Lao-Chinese families tend to be isolated. \n“We are a bit frustrated with (China). They create their own eco-system,” a Lao businessman said. \n(Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Idrees Ali, Michael Martina and Ben Blanchard.; Editing by John Chalmers and Bill Tarrant) Share This:",

	      "text": " 50pm BST Former Obama aide calls Trump a 'psychopath' Republican nominee Donald Trump speaks at ''Joni's Roast and Ride'' in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., August 27, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri \nWASHINGTON A former top adviser to President Barack Obama on Sunday labelled Donald Trump a \"psychopath\", saying the Republican presidential nominee met the clinical definition of the personality disorder. \nWith a little more than two months to go before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, the comments by David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and manager of his 2008 presidential campaign, mark another escalation in a series of blows exchanged between Trump's camp and that of his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. \n\"Basically, you have a psychopath running for president. I mean, he meets the clinical definition,\" Plouffe   on NBC's \"Meet the Press\". \nWhen challenged, Plouffe acknowledged he had no degree in psychology but rattled off what he said were the New York businessman's symptoms: \"grandiose notion of self-worth; pathological lying; lack of empathy and remorse.\" \nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nLast week, Clinton accused Trump of fuelling America's \"radical fringe\" with racist rhetoric, while Trump said Clinton was letting down black Americans with failed policies and called her a \"bigot who sees people of colour only as votes, not as human beings.\" \nObama has also lambasted Trump, saying of him: \"Somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.\" \n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky) Trending Stories",

	      "text": "DALLAS (AP) — The day after five Dallas officers were killed by a sniper, the city's police chief described the men as \"guardians\" of democracy, praising them for protecting the freedom to protest at a large demonstration against police brutality. President Barack Obama later eulogized the slain officers, saying they died while defending essential constitutional rights.\nBut nearly two months after the shootings, Dallas police have moved to silence critics and squelch lingering questions about the attack. Officers in riot gear have been told to ticket protesters who block or disrupt traffic, and Police Chief David Brown has refused to meet with demonstrators unless they agree to end their marches through downtown, which he says pose a threat to officers.\nAuthorities have also refused to release even the most basic information about the slayings, including any details about the weapons used, the autopsy findings and ballistics tests that could establish whether any officers were hit by friendly fire. Police have indicated that such information could be withheld almost indefinitely.\nIn addition, the police department's most vocal, visible critic — a 27-year-old self-styled preacher with a criminal history — has been arrested multiple times in the last month on warrants that include unpaid traffic tickets and attempts to revoke his probation from a 2009 felony. On Friday, Dominique Alexander was ordered to prison.\n\"Why all of a sudden are we the target?\" asked Damon Crenshaw, vice president of the Next Generation Action Network, which organized the July 7 protest. \"We're not protesting because we're mad at them. We're protesting because the problems still exist and they won't talk to us.\"\nCrenshaw said Alexander was targeted because of his protest activities and that the shooter, Micah Johnson, was not affiliated with their group.\nDallas has a history of cracking down on protesters.\nDuring the Occupy Dallas demonstrations in 2011, the city tried to require protesters to have a $1 million insurance policy, strengthened rules against camping in the city and eventually evicted campers from City Hall in a midnight police raid.\nIn 2013, the city cited a decades-old rule prohibiting holding signs within 75 feet of major roadways to stop a group that planned to protest the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. The city settled a lawsuit from that group before changing the law to prohibit protests on overpasses and other areas near highways. Another group sued over that law leading to another settlement, and the city repealed the rules all together.\nAlexander, the founder of the protest network, believes he was targeted because he refused to stop the demonstrations.\n\"They try to hush and silence people,\" he said. \"It would be a failure to the lives lost if we don't continue. The issues still exist, and they can act like they want to heal, but then they ignore the issues.\"\nThe police chief has support from City Hall. Mayor Mike Rawlings said in a statement that he trusts Brown's \"judgment in how he communicates with protest organizers.\"\nAlexander, whose record includes convictions for forging a check, evading police and theft, was on probation for a 2009 conviction for causing injury to a child. He said the 2-year-old he was watching had fallen off the couch, but hospital staff said the child's injuries were more consistent with abuse.\nAlexander denied injuring the child and said he pleaded guilty because he could not afford a good attorney.\nHis uncle was killed by police in 2010 after firing on officers. But it was the 2014 death of a woman he knew in high school that prompted his involvement in police protests, Alexander said. The woman was missing for a week before being found dead in an abandoned building. Her family complained that police ignored their initial pleas for help.\nAlexander spent the past two weeks under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor and awaiting a judge's determination of whether his probation would be revoked.\n\"No new crime has been committed to warrant this kind of action,\" said Kim Cole, one of Alexander's attorneys. \"And the timing does appear suspicious.\"\nJust days after a July 29 silent protest — the first following the sniper attack — authorities asked that Alexander's probation be revoked for a variety of violations, including twice leaving the state without notifying his probation officer, once to attend the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Court records show the judge admonished Alexander and added 30 hours of community service to his sentence.\nThen on Aug. 10, following a confrontational appearance at a city council meeting, Alexander was cited for trespassing and escorted out of City Hall, where officers were waiting to arrest him on nine outstanding traffic ticket warrants. He spent the night in jail and, within an hour of his release, another arrest warrant was issued in a new attempt to revoke probation. That request rehashed clprevious allegations from the past year, including missed meetings with his probation officer, for which Alexander had already served 10 days in jail in December.\nAt Friday's hearing, the judge considered all of Alexander's probation violations and sent him to prison for two years. With credit for time served, that comes to about six months, his attorneys said.\nProsecutor Douglas Millican denied that politics were behind the efforts to revoke Alexander's probation. But Cole said Alexander got extra scrutiny because of his protest activities, noting that police and sheriff's officers had provided the judge with social media posts and other photos and video of Alexander to show he had left the state.\nIn addition to the protest crackdowns, city and police officials have also succeeded in suppressing questions about the shooting, including details about the law enforcement response and the motive of the gunman, who was killed when police deployed a bomb-carrying robot. It was the first time law enforcement in the U.S. had used a robot to deliver and detonate an explosive to kill a suspect.\nAuthorities have refused public records requests for police reports, 911 calls, audio and video recordings, autopsy documents, crime scene photos and evidence gathered at Johnson's house, which police initially said held an arsenal of weapons and bomb-making material and a journal of combat tactics possibly indicating plans for a larger attack. Other officials have told The Associated Press that Johnson did not have a large stockpile of bomb-making materials.\nThe Associated Press was informed by Dallas police late Friday that a portion of the records it requested would be made available, but the content was unclear.\nBrown told the City Council earlier this month that much of the information about the attack could be withheld for an indefinite period during an investigation into whether the use of force was justified. He declined to estimate how long that investigation might take, but said his office's findings would be reviewed by the district attorney and a grand jury.\nThe police chief did acquiesce to one of the protest network's top demands, agreeing to eliminate a 2013 policy allowing officers 72 hours to give a statement after being involved in a shooting. The move, announced in a nighttime post to the department's blog, said officers \"will be provided the same legal rights as any other citizen who is the subject of a criminal investigation.\"",

	      "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida voters will go to the polls Tuesday and select the nominees for U.S. Senate, decide whether to amend the state constitution to give a property tax break to promote solar energy and have a say in who should represent them in the U.S. House. Here's a look at the races and issues facing Florida on Election Day. ___\nREPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY\nMarco Rubio's last minute decision to run for re-election almost, but not quite, cleared the field in what was a crowded Republican primary to replace him. Rubio said while running for president that he wouldn't seek a second Senate term. He repeated that claim when he dropped out of the race after badly losing the Florida presidential primary to Donald Trump. Then he changed his mind, causing Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez Cantera, U.S. Reps. Ron DeSantis and David Jolly and businessman Todd Wilcox to drop out of the race. But homebuilder Carlos Beruff stayed in and has spent about $8 million dollars of his own money on his first run for office. He has repeatedly criticized Rubio for missing votes while running for president and failing to enthusiastically back Trump for president, but was still badly trailing Rubio in the polls as the primary approached. Rubio has campaigned as if he's already won the nomination, refusing to debate Beruff and focusing more on his Democratic opponents.\n___\nDEMOCRATIC SENATE PRIMARY\nU.S. Reps. Patrick Murphy and Alan Grayson are the two leading candidates to take on Rubio and have led strikingly different campaigns. Murphy wrapped up major endorsements early in the campaign and is the establishment favorite to try to win back Sen. Marco Rubio's seat as Democrats try to regain a Senate majority. Murphy has excelled at fundraising and is backed by President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Grayson has a reputation for being a fiery, outspoken liberal who isn't afraid to break beyond political norms. Most of fundraising has been through small donations. Both candidates have had issues during the race. Grayson has been dogged by ethics allegations over an offshore hedge fund he managed and a claim by the mother of his children that he abused her over two decades. He has said he's done nothing wrong. Murphy has been criticized for embellishing his resume and for relying on $1.5 million in contributions his father gave to super PACs supporting his campaign.\n___\nDEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is facing her first primary since winning office in 2004. She has been one of the Democratic Party's top leaders in Congress and served as Democratic National Committee chairwoman at President Barack Obama's request for nearly five years, resigning in July after the DNC's emails were hacked. The leaked emails showed staffers privately were supporting Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary. Her opponent is Tim Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor who says Wasserman Schultz has lost her liberal values by sucking up to big donors and Wall Street. Sanders endorsed Canova, leading to a flood of donations from outside Florida in what appears to be an effort to take revenge at the party establishment for the way the presidential primary was handled. Canova has raised about $3.3 million — more than Wasserman Schultz and an astounding amount for a first time candidate running against someone who has served the area for more than 24 years in the state Legislature and Congress.\n___\nU.S. HOUSE\nFlorida's congressional maps were ripped up and redrawn last year after the state Legislature lost a court battle. The state Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers violated a voter-approved constitutional amendment requiring districts to be drawn in a compact manner that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties. That's contributed to one of the most active election years for congressional races. At least seven of Florida's 27 U.S. House members will be newly elected due to members retiring or seeking other political offices. Many of the state's congressional primaries almost assure the victor will be elected in November because of the political makeup of the district. Republican primaries to replace retiring GOP Congressmen Jeff Miller, Ander Crenshaw, Curt Clawson and Richard Nugent will likely decide who is sent to Washington in November. The same goes for the Republican primary to replace Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, who is exploring a run for governor after her district was redrawn in a way that favors the GOP. Democratic primaries to replace U.S. Reps. Alan Grayson and Patrick Murphy, who are running for Senate, will also likely choose the next members of Congress in those districts.\n___\nSOLAR ENERGY\nVoters will decide on a ballot measure to provide property tax breaks for people who install solar panels on their homes. Amendment 4 was placed on the ballot by a unanimous vote in both chambers of the Legislature. The increased value to a home from the installation of solar panels or other renewable energy devices can't be considered when assessing homes to determine property taxes. Environmentalists and business interests support the measure, which must receive 60 percent approval to pass.\n___\nFLORIDA VOTERS\nFlorida has nearly 12.4 million voters, including more than 4.4 million Republicans, 4.7 million Democrats and 2.9 million voters who aren't registered with any party. Voting by mail began more than a month before the primary and in-person early voting began up to 15 days before the primary. More than 2.3 million requested vote-by-mail ballots and nearly 500,000 had cast ballots at early voting sites by Saturday.",

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK \nNEW YORK Nearly a third of U.S. counties will likely be served by only one insurer that participates in an Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace in 2017, according to an analysis published Sunday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. \nThe 31 percent of U.S. counties that will have just a single option of insurers within the ACA's exchanges would represent an increase from 7 percent this year, the nonpartisan group found. \nUnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) and Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) have decided to largely exit government-run online marketplaces in 2017 that sell subsidized plans created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, citing low enrollment and high service costs. \nThe bulk of the decrease in counties with a choice of insurers is due to UnitedHealth's pullback, which was announced in April. \nThe data underscores the degree to which industry retrenchment is curtailing individual's options within the marketplaces. Insurer departures may lead to higher costs within that market, analysts have said. \nOne county - Pinal County, Arizona - risks having no insurer options at all within the marketplace, the analysis found. \nHowever, the study's authors said another plan offered elsewhere in the state could expand to serve the county. The foundation also said it could take more months and more data for the full impact of the changes for 2017 to become clear. \nA spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was not immediately available for comment, but the agency has said that the ACA has helped increase the number of options available to individuals. \n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Paul Tait) Trending Stories ",

	      "text": "DALLAS (AP) — The day after five Dallas officers were killed by a sniper, the city's police chief described the men as \"guardians\" of democracy, praising them for protecting the freedom to protest at a large demonstration against police brutality. President Barack Obama later eulogized the slain officers, saying they died while defending essential constitutional rights.\nBut nearly two months after the shootings, Dallas police have moved to silence critics and squelch lingering questions about the attack. Officers in riot gear have been told to ticket protesters who block or disrupt traffic, and Police Chief David Brown has refused to meet with demonstrators unless they agree to end their marches through downtown, which he says pose a threat to officers.\nAuthorities have also refused to release even the most basic information about the slayings, including any details about the weapons used, the autopsy findings and ballistics tests that could establish whether any officers were hit by friendly fire. Police have indicated that such information could be withheld almost indefinitely.\nIn addition, the police department's most vocal, visible critic — a 27-year-old self-styled preacher with a criminal history — has been arrested multiple times in the last month on warrants that include unpaid traffic tickets and attempts to revoke his probation from a 2009 felony. On Friday, Dominique Alexander was ordered to prison.\n\"Why all of a sudden are we the target?\" asked Damon Crenshaw, vice president of the Next Generation Action Network, which organized the July 7 protest. \"We're not protesting because we're mad at them. We're protesting because the problems still exist and they won't talk to us.\"\nCrenshaw said Alexander was targeted because of his protest activities and that the shooter, Micah Johnson, was not affiliated with their group.\nDallas has a history of cracking down on protesters.\nDuring the Occupy Dallas demonstrations in 2011, the city tried to require protesters to have a $1 million insurance policy, strengthened rules against camping in the city and eventually evicted campers from City Hall in a midnight police raid.\nIn 2013, the city cited a decades-old rule prohibiting holding signs within 75 feet of major roadways to stop a group that planned to protest the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. The city settled a lawsuit from that group before changing the law to prohibit protests on overpasses and other areas near highways. Another group sued over that law leading to another settlement, and the city repealed the rules all together.\nAlexander, the founder of the protest network, believes he was targeted because he refused to stop the demonstrations.\n\"They try to hush and silence people,\" he said. \"It would be a failure to the lives lost if we don't continue. The issues still exist, and they can act like they want to heal, but then they ignore the issues.\"\nThe police chief has support from City Hall. Mayor Mike Rawlings said in a statement that he trusts Brown's \"judgment in how he communicates with protest organizers.\"\nAlexander, whose record includes convictions for forging a check, evading police and theft, was on probation for a 2009 conviction for causing injury to a child. He said the 2-year-old he was watching had fallen off the couch, but hospital staff said the child's injuries were more consistent with abuse.\nAlexander denied injuring the child and said he pleaded guilty because he could not afford a good attorney.\nHis uncle was killed by police in 2010 after firing on officers. But it was the 2014 death of a woman he knew in high school that prompted his involvement in police protests, Alexander said. The woman was missing for a week before being found dead in an abandoned building. Her family complained that police ignored their initial pleas for help.\nAlexander spent the past two weeks under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor and awaiting a judge's determination of whether his probation would be revoked.\n\"No new crime has been committed to warrant this kind of action,\" said Kim Cole, one of Alexander's attorneys. \"And the timing does appear suspicious.\"\nJust days after a July 29 silent protest — the first following the sniper attack — authorities asked that Alexander's probation be revoked for a variety of violations, including twice leaving the state without notifying his probation officer, once to attend the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Court records show the judge admonished Alexander and added 30 hours of community service to his sentence.\nThen on Aug. 10, following a confrontational appearance at a city council meeting, Alexander was cited for trespassing and escorted out of City Hall, where officers were waiting to arrest him on nine outstanding traffic ticket warrants. He spent the night in jail and, within an hour of his release, another arrest warrant was issued in a new attempt to revoke probation. That request rehashed clprevious allegations from the past year, including missed meetings with his probation officer, for which Alexander had already served 10 days in jail in December.\nAt Friday's hearing, the judge considered all of Alexander's probation violations and sent him to prison for two years. With credit for time served, that comes to about six months, his attorneys said.\nProsecutor Douglas Millican denied that politics were behind the efforts to revoke Alexander's probation. But Cole said Alexander got extra scrutiny because of his protest activities, noting that police and sheriff's officers had provided the judge with social media posts and other photos and video of Alexander to show he had left the state.\nIn addition to the protest crackdowns, city and police officials have also succeeded in suppressing questions about the shooting, including details about the law enforcement response and the motive of the gunman, who was killed when police deployed a bomb-carrying robot. It was the first time law enforcement in the U.S. had used a robot to deliver and detonate an explosive to kill a suspect.\nAuthorities have refused public records requests for police reports, 911 calls, audio and video recordings, autopsy documents, crime scene photos and evidence gathered at Johnson's house, which police initially said held an arsenal of weapons and bomb-making material and a journal of combat tactics possibly indicating plans for a larger attack. Other officials have told The Associated Press that Johnson did not have a large stockpile of bomb-making materials.\nThe Associated Press was informed by Dallas police late Friday that a portion of the records it requested would be made available, but the content was unclear.\nBrown told the City Council earlier this month that much of the information about the attack could be withheld for an indefinite period during an investigation into whether the use of force was justified. He declined to estimate how long that investigation might take, but said his office's findings would be reviewed by the district attorney and a grand jury.\nThe police chief did acquiesce to one of the protest network's top demands, agreeing to eliminate a 2013 policy allowing officers 72 hours to give a statement after being involved in a shooting. The move, announced in a nighttime post to the department's blog, said officers \"will be provided the same legal rights as any other citizen who is the subject of a criminal investigation.\"",

Picture taken July 29, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song 1/2 left right The buildings of a conference centre, where the G20 summit will be held, is pictured in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, August 3, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo 2/2 By Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina | BEIJING \nBEIJING China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world's biggest economies this weekend, but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage. \nEnsuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping's priorities, and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G20 summit to be. \nBeijing wants to use the Sept 4-5 meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth, but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism, diplomats said. \n\"From where China sits, it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them,\" said a senior Western envoy, describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G20 as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea. \nIn recent months, China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington. \nWhile China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully, Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea, going by reports in state media. \nChina has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting, which will be attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other world leaders. \nState media has given great play to the idea that G20 is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth, with the official People's Daily saying this could be one of the G20's most fruitful ever get-togethers. \n\"Let's make cooperation ever higher,\" it wrote in a commentary last week. \nBut the state-run Study Times wrote in mid-August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership. \n\"Trying to get back their right to global governance, they are forging a new 'sacred alliance', striving to establish new rules,\" the influential paper, published twice a week by the Central Party School, wrote in a G20 commentary. \n\"These new rules will exclude China.\" \nANGERED BY BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA \nOverseas, China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries, saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia. \nAustralia has blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders, while Britain has delayed a $24 billion Chinese-invested nuclear project. \nBut Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it. \nJoerg Wuttke, the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China's overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies. \"It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more. They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies,\" Wuttke told Reuters. \nA European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China's attitude on protectionism. \n\"The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids. You wouldn't get to the end of the sentence,\" the official added. \nNone of this will make for plain sailing at G20. \n\"China is angry with almost everyone at the moment,\" said a second Beijing-based Western diplomat familiar with the summit. \nTo be sure, China does want G20 to go smoothly, said a third Western diplomat. \n\"It's very important from the stance of national pride,\" said the diplomat, pointing out it was not uncommon for G20s to be hijacked by issues other than economics. \n\"It's a minefield for China.\" \nJAPAN WORRIES \nThen there is Japan, a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. \nLast week, China's top diplomat called on Japan to be \"constructive\" at G20, with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well, at the behest of its ally the United States. \nWang Youming, the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G20 got, the more Japan was trying to cause trouble. \n\"Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues, cozying up to the Philippines, and urging China to respect the result of the so-called 'arbitration' case,\" Wang wrote. \n\"Japan is up to its old tricks, and it's hard not to think they are trying to mess things up.\" \n(Additional reporting by Gao Liangping and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan) Trending Stories",

	      "text": "By Pamela McClintock, The Hollywood Reporter \nElsewhere, Obama date movie Southside With You opens to mediocre numbers overall, but knocks out boxing drama Hands of Stone ; Jason Statham’s The Mechanic: Resurrecton doesn’t match the 2011 film.     Score another win for the horror genre.\nDon’t Breathe scared away the dog days of August at the North American box office in opening to $26.1 million from 3,501 theaters, well ahead of expectations. The movie, from Sony’s Screen Gems and Stage 6 Films, is sure to be profitable for the studio, considering it cost $10 million to make.\nWriter-director Fede Alvarez’s well-reviewed, R-rated movie follows a delinquent teenage girl and her boyfriend, along with another friend, whose attempt to rob a blind man’s house takes a terrifying turn. Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto and Stephen Lang star in Don’t Breathe , which earned a B+ CinemaScore, unusual for a horror title.\nDon’t Breathe is the latest horror film to strike gold during an otherwise difficult summer, a crop that includes The Conjuring 2 and Lights Out , both from New Line/Warner Bros., and Universal and Blumhouse’s The Purge: Election Year .\n“To more than double your production budget on opening weekend is a fantastic result,” said Sony worldwide president of marketing and distribution Josh Greenstein. “It’s the latest in a string of low-budget movies that have been very profitable movies for Sony, including The Shallows and Sausage Party . And Fede is a master storyteller.”\nMore: ‘Southside With You’ Director on Where His Obama Date Movie Fits in the Current Presidential Race \nAfter ruling the box office for three consecutive weekends, David Ayers’ anti-superhero tentpole Suicide Squad fell to No. 2 with $12.1 million from 3,582 theaters for a domestic total of $282.9 million.\nThe late-August weekend included three other new nationwide releases: Obama biographical romance Southside With You , action film Mechanic: Resurrection and the Roberto Duran boxing biopic Hands of Stone , although Southside and Hands of Stone, both indie films, opened in far fewer theaters.\nJason Statham-starrer Mechanic: Resurrection debuted to $7.5 million from 3,246 theaters, below the $11.4 million opening of The Mechanic in 2011. Lionsgate’s label Lionsgate Premiere is releasing Resurrection on behalf of Millennium Films, which put up much of the financing. The two partners are hoping for a strong afterlife in home entertainment.\nBen Foster and Jessica Alba star opposite Statham in the male-fueled action film, which only managed a seventh-place finish.\nSouthside With You , which follows a young President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama (then Michelle Robinson) on their first date in 1989 when they were young lawyers at the same Chicago firm, opened to roughly $3 million from 813 theaters.\nOverall, Southside With You ’s opening is mediocre, although it did do decent business in certain cities including Chicago, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Baltimore, Memphis, New York and Los Angeles. (African-Americans made up a majority of the audience.)\nMore: 'Mechanic: Resurrection’: Film Review \nA passion project for first-time feature director Richard Tanne, Southside stars Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter and was fully financed by IM Global. Miramax and Roadside Attractions partnered in picking up U.S. rights to Southside out of the Sundance Film Festival, where the film was met with critical acclaim.\nMiramax and Roadside initially planned a limited release but decided for a somewhat wider footprint based on a successful screening program and glowing reviews.\nSouthside With You was able to knock out the Weinstein Co.’s Hands of Stone starring Robert De Niro and Edgar Ramirez, which opened to $1.7 million from 810 locations. The film, which debuted out of competition in Cannes in May, tells the true story of famed Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran (Ramirez), who was coached to greatness in the 1970s by trainer Ray Arcel (De Niro).\nTWC notes that Hands of Stone earned an A CinemaScore, which could bode well for the film’s major expansion into as many as 2,500 theaters on Wednesday, Aug. 31, the eve of the long Labor Day weekend.\nMore: Harvey Weinstein Jabs Donald Trump at Panama-Proud 'Hands of Stone’ Premiere \nCBS Films and Lionsgate’s Hell or High Water — one of the best reviewed films of the year — continues to prosper as it expands into a total of 909 theaters. The modern-day Western, a heist film starring Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster, will out-grossed both Southside and Hands of Stone with $3.7 million, pushing its domestic total to $8.6 million, one of the strongest showings of the year for a film getting a platform release.",

Republicans narrow voter registration gap in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania By Marshall Cohen, CNN Updated 1008 GMT (1808 HKT) August 29, 2016 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Why PA voters switched registration to GOP for primary 01:10 Story highlights Republicans are gaining ground in three states that could determine the presidential election The GOP added about 300,000 more voters than Democrats since November 2012 in Florida Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is enjoying a strong summer but her party's voter registration advantage is shrinking in three battleground states that could decide the election, according to a CNN analysis of newly released registration data. With 10 weeks to go, Clinton is favored in CNN's latest Electoral College map. And there are still more registered Democrats than Republicans in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. But the GOP has improved its position in all three states by adding hundreds of thousands of voters to the rolls. Shifts in voter registration don't necessarily indicate who is attracting new voters, because the rolls are fluid. People switch parties, or move to a new state. Voters die and are removed from the list. And other factors -- like this year's competitive GOP primary -- can boost registration levels. But when available, these statistics provide clues about the electorate and the changing political landscape. GOP gains ground in Florida On Election Day in 2012, there were 557,544 more registered Democrats in Florida than Republicans. But President Barack Obama only won the state by 74,309 votes out of more than 8.4 million ballots cast. Read More This time around, Clinton could have a smaller cushion, because the GOP added about 300,000 more voters than Democrats since November 2012. About half of those Republicans were added in the past year alone, according to the Florida Department of State. The Democratic edge is now about 259,000. Some of this shift has been driven by changes in Florida's white electorate. Democrats lost almost 195,000 white voters since the 2012 election, while Republicans gained about 149,000 white voters, the Department of State reported. But there is good news for Democrats: They added 92,000 Hispanics to their voter rolls since 2012, and two-thirds of them were registered between February and August of this year. A Florida Democratic Party official also said three-quarters of all first-time voters registered since 2012 were non-white. \"I don't look at this as being dire for Democrats,\" said Professor Daniel Smith, who teaches political science at the University of Florida. \"Their registration has been healthy, and their demographics are more representative of the state electorate. On the Republican side, it's disproportionately white.\" In 2012, Democrats padded their lead by 102,000 voters in the fall. To replicate that, they could look to the 800,000 college students returning now to Florida schools. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine held a voter registration event Friday at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee. Tightening in North Carolina North Carolina was the second-closest state in 2012, when Republican Mitt Romney won by only about 92,000 votes. It could be tight again: Trump and Clinton are essentially tied there in the latest CNN/ORC poll . So far, compared to this time in 2012, the Democratic lead has narrowed by about 123,000 voters, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. And in the past year, Republicans doubled Democrats in terms of registration gains. The current Democratic lead is almost 642,000 voters. Even though Democrats have the clear registration edge, Republicans still hold the governorship, both U.S. Senate seats, and 10 of 13 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. There is one possible explanation: Some Tar Heel Democrats might not be stalwart Democrats after all. \"If you're 70 years old, and you registered 50 years ago, more of those older people all registered as Democrats,\" said Carter Wrenn, a veteran Republican strategist who has managed nine winning statewide races in North Carolina. \"A lot of those older people are ticket splitters. About 15% of Democrats, mostly older Democrats, usually vote for the Republican nominee for president.\" Dem edge drops in Pennsylvania The latest polls suggest Clinton has a clear lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, and Democrats have long enjoyed a wide registration edge in the Keystone State. They still lead today, but it's smaller than at any time since November 2007, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State. Republicans outpaced Democrats this past year, netting 83,000 more voters. This helped drive down the Democratic advantage to about 916,000, which hasn't been under 1 million in a presidential year since 2004, when Democrat John Kerry beat President George W. Bush by about 144,000 votes. Kerry, and then Obama in 2008 and 2012, carried the state because they netted hundreds of thousands of votes from Philadelphia. To close the gap this year, and to make a play for the state's 20 electoral votes, Trump has focused on Rust Belt towns in Western Pennsylvania, where he thrived in the primary. \"We're an area that was historically Democratic but has been trending Republican for about 20 years now,\" said Michael Korns, chairman of the Westmoreland County Republican Committee, in the Pittsburgh suburbs. \"We're seeing an acceleration of a trend that we've been seeing develop over the years. We're getting people to embrace the Republican Party and actually become full members.\" Rep. Tom Marino, Trump's chairman in Pennsylvania, said the campaign believes at least 80,000 Democrats have switched their registration to the Republican Party this year. Democrats see progress out west In Colorado and Arizona, Republicans have a registration edge, but Democrats are narrowing the gap. In the past year, Democrats netted 45,000 more voters in Colorado and about 19,000 in Arizona. Ten years ago, Colorado Republicans had registration edge of 170,000 voters. That shrunk to about 33,000 voters in 2012, and today it stands at 12,000, according to the Colorado Secretary of State. The Democratic gains are likely coming from an influx of Hispanic and college-educated voters. \"We continue to see strong support for Hillary Clinton in expanding diverse communities across the country,\" said Clinton campaign spokeswoman Sabrina Singh. Boosted by these gains, and by strong polls, the Clinton campaign recently decided it won't reserve airtime for television ads this fall in Colorado . As that state becomes less competitive, Arizona is heating up: Clinton trails Trump by just 5 points in the latest CNN/ORC poll. Sections",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic 5/5 By Gordana Katana | BANJA LUKA, Bosnia \nBANJA LUKA, Bosnia A Bosnian Serb factory on Monday presented two pairs of shoes as a gift for the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Slovenian-born Melania, in a gesture of support for Trump's White House campaign. \nMany Serbs in the Balkans back Trump, ill-disposed to rival Hillary Clinton whose husband Bill backed NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions toward the end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He also advocated a 1999 NATO bombing of then-Yugolsavia to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians. \nMarinko Umicevic, technical director at the Banja Luka shoe factory Bema, said the gift countered what she called a \"dirty campaign\" against the aspiring First Lady whose homeland, like Bosnia, was a part of Yugoslavia when she was born. \nMelania Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention in July ignited controversy, containing a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by President Barack Obama, Michelle. \n\"The shoes for Melania Trump are our response to the dirty comments she has been exposed to as a wife and a mother,\" said Umicevic. \nThe shoes, to be sent by express post, were displayed for media on a table, set in a display of white roses. One pair was gold-colored, with cushioned soles fashioned, according to Umicevic, to help Melania follow her husband's campaign across America. The others were white stilettos for a triumphant walk into the White House. \nUmicevic said the shoe moulds were made by a factory in Melania Trump's hometown of Sevnice and designed by Bema's best shoe designers. \n\"We hope that America will stop being the world policeman,\" Umicevic told Reuters. \"We are hoping a friendship will come in the future from the United States instead of bombs that Serbs got from Bill Clinton,\" he added. \n(Writing by Maja Zuvela) ",

	      "text": "Miami (AFP) - Hurricane Madeline is expected to pass near Hawaii around midweek, US weather forecasters said Monday, possibly wreaking havoc with a planned visit by President Barack Obama and other dignitaries. Madeline is expected to travel over or near the Big Island on Wednesday, carrying heavy rain and strong winds, according to the US National Weather Service.\nIts current path in the central Pacific could coincide with Obama's planned visit to Hawaii for the kickoff of the World Conservation Congress, a major meeting including thousands of heads of state, scientists and policy makers.\nAt 0900 GMT, Madeline was 755 miles (1,220 kilometers) east of Hilo, Hawaii.\nThe category one hurricane has maximum sustained winds of 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour, and was moving toward the northwest at about 10 miles per hour.\nForecasters said, however, that models show a great deal of uncertainty about the path of Madeline, which they are tracking closely.\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature stages the World Conservation Congress every four years at a different location around the globe. This year it runs from September 1-10.\nObama is scheduled to address the gathering on September 1.\nThe US leader is also expected to travel to Midway Atoll, inside a newly named protected area, where Obama burnished his environmental bona fides last week by establishing the world's largest marine reserve, home to thousands of rare sea creatures in the northwestern Hawaiian islands.\nMeanwhile a hurricane in the Atlantic, Gaston, has surged to a Category Three storm, US weather trackers said.\nGaston is the first major hurricane of the Atlantic season, the National Hurricane Center.\nGaston, packing top sustained winds of 115 miles (185 kilometers) per hour, was stationary about 575 miles from Bermuda, the Miami-based NHC said at 0900 GMT Monday.\nThe storm was not an immediate threat to land, and was expected to remain near its current strength, picking up speed as it travels toward the northeast over the next couple of days, forecasters said.",

	      "text": " 48am EDT Climate change looms large in Obama's final trip to Asia U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about the National Park Service at Yosemite National Park, California, U.S., June 18, 2016. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo By Roberta Rampton | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON When President Barack Obama sets out this week to meet world leaders in China and Laos during his final presidential trip to Asia, he will make an unusual stop along the way. \nWith time running out for more action on climate change during his time in office, Obama will drop in to Midway Atoll, a far-flung and largely uninhabited coral reef that is a refuge for sharks, albatrosses and endangered turtles and seals. \nThe photo-rich stop is aimed at both raising awareness about the threat posed by climate change, and showcasing Obama's decision to protect a larger part of the ocean around Hawaii. \nBut the trip to the middle of the Pacific Ocean will also highlight the high stakes of climate change just before Obama meets world leaders in China. \n\"I think it's going to be an amazing sequence, and one that really matters,\" said Doug McCauley, a conservation biologist from University of California, Santa Barbara. \n\"Suddenly, you're sitting in a room with the leaders who will decide what the fate of that place is going to be,\" McCauley said. \nThe rare trip is both a signal of the importance Obama gives to climate change - and a sign of his focus in bliateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \nThe two leaders have clashed on economic and security issues, but forged common ground on climate, which helped secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions at a Paris conference last year. \n\"We have to recognize that climate change and clean energy cooperation has really helped to create better overall stability in the U.S.-China relationship, writ large,\" said Andrew Light, a former senior climate official in Obama's State Department. \nLight, now with the World Resources Institute think tank, said he expects Xi and Obama will try to push other G20 leaders to agree to timelines for implementing the Paris agreement and work on cutting other greenhouse gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons. \nAny progress on climate issues could be a rare bright spot in a trip otherwise dominated by concerns about the international economy, anti-globalization sentiments and global security problems. \nWith less than five months left in the White House, Obama is racing to cement his record through actions he can take without help from the gridlocked U.S. Congress. \nFor example, at Obama's final meeting with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, the leaders set new goals for clean energy production. \nRepublicans in Congress have thwarted Obama's legislative efforts on climate, and mocked him for his focus on an issue they see as less pressing than the economy and defense. \nObama also has faced criticism from environmental groups for not doing more to limit U.S. oil and gas production. \n\"If we're going address the climate crisis or meet our climate commitments, the vast, vast majority of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground,\" said Brendan Cummings, conservation director with the Center for Biological Diversity. \nBut former Environmental Protection Agency director Carol Browner said Obama has done what he could on climate both through leadership on the international stage, and by using existing laws to kick-start the clean energy sector and cut emissions from vehicles and power plants. \n\"Nobody should ever be disappointed with this president on climate change,\" said Browner, who led the White House climate push in Obama's first term. \n(Editing by Alistair Bell)",

	      "text": "Politics | Mon Aug 29, 2016 1:18pm EDT Republicans ask Clinton Foundation to produce correspondence U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stands with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, after accepting the nomination on the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nNEW YORK The Republican National Committee asked the charity of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's family on Monday to produce all correspondence its staff had with the U.S. State Department while Clinton served as America's most senior diplomat. \nClinton's campaign to win the Nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism that donors to the Clinton Foundation may have expected special favors from the U.S. government in return. She says donors to the global charity receive no preferential treatment. \n\"The Clinton Foundation can play a vital role in filling important gaps in the public record by demonstrating its commitment to transparency and making public all correspondence its officials had with the State Department during Secretary Clinton's tenure,\" Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, said in a letter to the foundation's president, Donna Shalala. \nThe RNC provided a copy of the letter to reporters. \nSpokesmen for Clinton and the foundation, which is known for its work to widen access to HIV medicines in developing countries, did not respond to a request for comment. \nSome emails have already emerged that show Clinton Foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton and other diplomats on behalf of supporters who have made large donations to the foundation. \nFoundation officials also sought other favors, including help with visa issues or urging the government to hire certain people, emails show. Spokesmen for Clinton have noted that in several cases the requests from foundation officials were unsuccessful. \nThousands more emails from Clinton's tenure are still in the process of being released as public records. Their release was delayed in part because of Clinton's decision to use an unauthorized private email server for her work without informing record-keeping officials. \nIn his letter, Priebus said the foundation's own records have \"the unique ability\" to establish whether donors received special treatment. \nClinton promised President Barack Obama that her family's charities would annually disclose all their donors and seek prior approval from the State Department for any additional money given by foreign governments when Obama made her his most senior diplomat in 2009. The charities said last year they failed to comply with the promises, blaming oversights. \nThe foundation has said it will no longer accept foreign or corporate funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, will remain on the board. \n(Editing by Alistair Bell) ",

	      "text": "World News | Mon Aug 29, 2016 1:39pm EDT New Cuba tourism seen slow to take off despite U.S. flights (L to R) Mayda Molina, an official of the Institute of the Cuban Civil Aviation, Eduardo Rodriguez, Cuba's vice-minister of Transport and Alfredo Cordero, President of the Institute of the Cuban Civil Aviation, attend a news conference in Havana, Cuba, August 29, 2016. REUTERS/Enrique de la Osa By Marc Frank and Jeffrey Dastin | HAVANA/NEW YORK \nHAVANA/NEW YORK An expected explosion in U.S. tourism to Cuba will likely take years to materialize even after U.S. airlines resume commercial flights to the Caribbean island this week for the first time since 1961, industry officials said. \nJetBlue Airways Corp ( JBLU.O ) will pilot its historic flight from Florida to the Cuban city of Santa Clara on Wednesday, the latest step in normalizing relations that earlier this year included a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama and the first U.S. cruise to the island in decades. \nThe planes may some day be filled with U.S. beach-goers, looking for an economical Caribbean break at resorts favored by Canadians and Europeans on the sandy keys north of Santa Clara. \nBut for now, U.S. law and constraints on Cuba's tourism infrastructure will act as brakes on increasing demand, experts said. \nCongress has yet to lift a trade embargo that prohibits U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba as tourists. The Obama administration has approved 12 categories of exceptions to the ban ranging from cultural, religious and educational travel to business and visiting family. \nThat means JetBlue's initial flights will mainly carry Cuban-Americans visiting relatives or other U.S. citizens interested in seeing the Che Guevara Mausoleum and other cultural sites. \nEventually, up to 25 flights a day by various carriers will connect the United States and the Cuban provinces, with another 20 to Havana, under an agreement reached by the two Cold War foes as part of a gradual détente begun in December 2014. \nServices on Silver Airways and American Airlines Group Inc ( AAL.O ) from the Miami area to other outlying provinces are the next to start, in September. \nWhile the direct flights could carry more than a million U.S. residents to Cuba annually, according to John Kavulich, head of the New York-based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc, he and other experts believe that mark will not be reached for several years. \nIn the beginning, the new routes are expected to absorb customers from the average of 17 charter flights that Cuba's government says have arrived from the United States daily for several years. \n\"The fares that have come out so far, announced by American and JetBlue, have been super competitive,\" said Bob Guild, vice president at Marazul Charters Inc. \"I don't have any question that it's going to shrink,\" he said of the charter services. Marazul, one of the largest charter companies operating to Cuba, plans to scale back services to provinces this fall but continue with its Havana flights while commercial airlines await approval, Guild said. \nHOTEL ROOMS FULL \nThere is already a boom in visits to Cuba from the United States. Some 300,000 Cubans living in the United States now travel home annually. In 2015, the Cuban government reported 161,233 Americans visited, compared to 91,254 in 2014, and arrivals through June nearly doubled over the same period last year, a trend that the dawn of commercial flights can only further. \n\"The fact that travelers can book flights directly online not only streamlines that process and makes it more affordable, it adds a feeling of legality,\" said Collin Laverty of Cuban Educational Travel. \nBut another barrier to increased U.S. travel is that Cuba's hotels, bed and breakfasts, transportation services and amenities are already stretched to the limit, with a record 3.5 million foreign arrivals last year. Higher hotel prices, pegged to the U.S. dollar, might push out some travelers from Europe and Canada, creating more space for Americans, said Emilio Morales, CEO of Miami-based Havana Consulting Group. Private bed and breakfasts would absorb what they could of increased demand, he said. \nOver time, airlines are betting travel restrictions will be further relaxed and want to get their foot in the door before Obama leaves office next year. \n\"While all of the flights are unlikely to operate at capacity, the airlines want to plant their respective flags,\" Kavulich said. \n(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Trending Stories",

Hide Caption 15 of 15 Story highlights After revelations in NY Post of alleged sexting, Huma Abedin has announced she is separating from Anthony Weiner We can't know what goes on in a marriage, the reasons for staying or going; this is true of Abedin, says Peggy Drexler Drexler: Let's not be so condescending as to congratulate her; ending a marriage is excruciating. No one can judge Peggy Drexler is the author of \"Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family\" and \"Raising Boys Without Men.\" She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) Sunday night, the New York Post published photos that appeared to have been sent last year between former US Rep. Anthony Weiner and a \"busty brunette out West\" (said the Post), following a tip from said brunette. Perhaps the most damning photo — if the media reaction is any indication — features what the paper says is Weiner's crotch, clothed only in white briefs, and a small boy beside him. The Post says the boy is his his son with Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's close aide. \"Someone just climbed into my bed,\" read the accompanying text message, according to the Post. The woman he was allegedly texting with was not an old friend. The Post received a number of explicit messages allegedly sent between her and Weiner between January 2015 and as recently as this month. JUST WATCHED",

Hide Caption 39 of 39 Story highlights The meeting is the first between Obama and Erdoğan since a coup attempt in Turkey failed in July Ankara wants the US to extradite a Pennsylvania-based Turkish cleric for alleged involvement Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama will meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of this week's Group of 20 meetings in China to discuss efforts against ISIS, the White House said on Monday. The meeting, the first between Obama and Erdoğan since a coup attempt in Turkey failed in July, comes amid differences in strategy against ISIS. The US has condemned Turkish strikes on opposition groups in Syria, saying they are distracting from the fight against ISIS, also known as ISIL. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned Turkish forces Monday against advancing further south of the Syrian city of Jarablus and clashing with US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. \"We have called upon Turkey to stay focused on the fight against ISIL and not to engage\" the SDF, Carter said while speaking to reporters at the Pentagon alongside his Indian counterpart. He signaled US support for Turkey's effort to liberate Jarablus and ISIS-controlled areas to the west. He also noted that the US had asked the Kurdish YPG to withdraw their forces east of the Euphrates and said \"they are doing that.\" Read More Obama's meeting is the latest in a string of high-level US officials' outreach to Turkish leaders. Last week, Vice President Joe Biden visited Turkey personally. RELATED: Biden aims to reassure Turks of US support after failed coup Ben Rhodes, White House deputy national security adviser, said the meeting between Obama and Erdoğan would focus on those issues, as well as expressing US support for Turkey in the aftermath of the coup attempt. Turkey, however, has taken issue with the US response. In particular, Ankara is currently asking the US to extradite a Pennsylvania-based Turkish cleric for alleged involvement in the attempted overthrow, but Obama administration is demanding evidence of participation. While in China, Obama is also planning to meet formally with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss climate issues and cybersecurity concerns, the White House said. He's also likely to interact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though no formal sit-down is scheduled. When Obama travels to Laos later in the week, he'll sit for talks with the controversial new leader of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has drawn criticism for harsh tactics in his battle against drugs. The US has expressed concerns about extrajudicial killings of drug dealers after Duterte's tough rhetoric about battling crime. Rhodes said he expected Obama to raise those concerns with the close American ally in their meeting in Laos. Sections",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED How to fix the presidential debates 03:55 Story highlights The first presidential debate is one month away. Lanhee J. Chen: There are five steps Trump can take to win the debate and make the fall campaign competitive again Lanhee J. Chen is a CNN Political Commentator and the David and Diane Steffy Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He was the policy director on the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and participated extensively in preparing Romney for his debate performances. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) The upcoming debates are Donald Trump's best (and likely last) chance to influence the course of this year's presidential election. The three general election debates planned over the next two months are crucial -- particularly for the candidate who is behind -- because they give voters a chance to see both candidates in their own words, free from the influence of scripted television ads or staged campaign events. A strong performance by the underdog, such as Mitt Romney's showing in the first debate against President Barack Obama in 2012, can force voters to take a second look at a candidate they may have written off and make the fall campaign competitive once more. Because these debates have potential to impact the race, observers are rightfully curious about what Trump has done to prepare for them. After all, a disciplined and targeted debate prep process helped Romney win the first matchup four years ago, and could do the same for Trump. Lanhee J. Chen Unfortunately, \"disciplined\" and \"targeted\" aren't words that have often been used to describe Trump or his campaign to date. If he wants the campaign to be competitive, Trump doesn't need to match Hillary Clinton word for word and policy for policy in the upcoming debates. But there are a few goals he should focus his preparation on: 1. Advancing the overarching strategic narrative of Clinton as untrustworthy and out-of-touch . Trump should understand that general election debates are, above all, an opportunity to draw an unflattering frame around your opponent. Each statement during the debate, as well as every exchange, should be focused on advancing the campaign's strongest argument against Clinton. For Trump, the strategic frame is fairly obvious: Clinton cannot be trusted and doesn't understand the needs of Americans across the country. To be successful, Trump should try to turn every answer and exchange during the debate back to this basic premise. JUST WATCHED Jeff Greenfield on the Clintons and the Trust Issue 03:49 Read More 2. Understanding the Clinton record and highlighting just the facts . Clinton's long record in the public spotlight may seem like an advantage, but Trump has to be prepared to exploit his opponent's soft spots in a way that is both accurate and terse. Trump needs to spend his prep time familiarizing himself with the points that substantiate his characterization of \"crooked Hillary.\" Knowing her record is key because there is plenty of ammunition Trump can use to make his point. He could, for example, point to Clinton's now discredited assertion that she did not disseminate classified information through her private email address. The trick for him will be to avoid conspiracy theories (such as those about Clinton's health) or outright false statements. Clearly, Trump has lacked this kind of discipline to date. But such unforced errors during the debate will only give Clinton the ability to discredit him or muddy the waters regarding who is more trustworthy. 3. Demonstrating that he has policy solutions to address the problems Americans care about . No one expects Trump to become a wonk overnight, and the appeal of his candidacy to date has had little to do with his expertise on matters of policy. But the general election debates demand that a candidate possess an understanding of the policy challenges facing America and an ability to articulate solutions addressing them. A one-on-one debate over the course of 90 minutes will, at some point, require Trump to engage on matters of policy. He doesn't need to be the world's foremost expert on any policy area, but he should be able to show Americans he has a plan and demonstrate that his plan will improve their lives. This is particularly the case with respect to economic policy. Trump's business background will be perceived by some voters as an advantage, while the economic anxiety being felt by many across the country places Clinton, as someone likely to continue Obama's economic policies, at a disadvantage. Hillary Clinton is a Bigot? The art of the reverse attack (Opinion) 4. Arguing why Clinton's solutions won't work . Just as Trump needs to be familiar with his own plans, so, too, would he benefit from some familiarity with what Clinton's policy proposals are. Here, again, Trump doesn't need to understand chapter and verse about what Clinton is proposing. He just needs to be able to argue why her policies would result in damage to the American economy or America's standing in the world. That also means characterizing them in a way that forces Clinton to play defense in areas where she has experience and is supposed to be strong, such as on foreign policy or health care. 5. Showing he has the temperament to be president . This is the toughest of the goals to prepare for, and arguably one that Trump simply cannot achieve. A recent survey conducted by Quinnipiac University found that 71% of likely voters do not believe he is \"level headed.\" In contrast, 62% of likely voters believe Clinton is. That encapsulates the challenge for Trump. During the first debate, in particular, Clinton will try to get under his skin and definitively demonstrate that he lacks the temperament and judgment to be president. Trump's significant task is to weather the storm and make Americans believe he can be a commander in chief who won't always be losing his cool. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook With the first debate less than a month away, Trump has a lot of prep to do if he wants to be successful.

But the good news for Trump and his campaign is that a strong debate performance can help the public envision him as presidential material and perhaps even make this election competitive again.

REUTERS/Abdalrhman Ismail By Phil Stewart | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON The United States scrambled on Monday to get its feuding allies, Turkey and Kurdish YPG militia, to focus their firepower on Islamic State instead of each other after clashes that have threatened to unravel America's war strategy in Syria. \nTurkey, which has long viewed Kurdish militants as its top security threat, upended U.S. assumptions about the conflict by launching a major push last week into northern Syria that has included areas controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes experienced Kurdish YPG fighters. \nIn turn, Turkey has blamed a rocket attack from a YPG-controlled area for the death of one of its soldiers on Saturday. Turkey said it killed 25 Kurdish militants on Sunday. \n\"We've called on both sides to not fight with one another, to continue to focus the fight on ISIL,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a Pentagon news conference, using an acronym for Islamic State. \nWhite House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said further Turkish targeting of the SDF, which also includes Arab fighters, would undermine efforts to forge a \"united front\" against Islamic State. \nBut experts say the Turkish offensive has again exposed the vastly different, often competing objectives of America's allies in the five-year-old conflict in Syria, where the Islamic State is only one of many actors. \nIt has also raised questions over whether Turkey will attempt to thwart any more major advances by the SDF, just weeks after the Pentagon hailed the group's victory against Islamic State in the town of Manbij, about 30 km (20 miles) south of Turkey's border. \nCarter signaled no change in U.S. strategy on Monday, stressing that both the SDF and Turkey were critical allies in Syria. The Pentagon hopes U.S.-backed forces can eventually retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islamic State. \n\"We do understand that they (Turkey and Kurdish fighters) have historical differences with one another but American interests are quite clear,\" Carter said. \"We, like they, want to combat ISIL and we are calling on them now: 'Let’s keep our priorities clear here.'\" \nTENSIONS WITH TURKEY \nExperts say the best-case scenario for defusing tensions would be for Turkey to accept U.S. assurances that the YPG is withdrawing east of the Euphrates river. Turkey, which wants to stop Kurdish forces from further extending their control near its border, has demanded such a withdrawal. \nCarter on Monday described the river as a natural barrier that would separate Turkey and the YPG. \n\"What we can do and are doing with them is to clarify where the YPG elements of the SDF are and are not,\" he said, adding YPG fighters were indeed withdrawing. \nIn a nod to Turkey, Carter also praised Turkish military advances against Islamic State in the past week, notably its seizure of the town of Jarablus. \nBlaise Misztal, director of national security at the Bipartisan Policy Center think-tank, said the United States was witnessing the consequences of a strategy that heavily depended on Kurdish fighters to defeat Islamic State, despite explicit Turkish objections. \nTurkey is battling a Kurdish insurgency on its soil. \n\"The enemy of my enemy is still my enemy,\" Misztal said. \nExperts warned that it was far from clear whether Ankara would back down, given that the United States was unlikely to side with Kurdish militia over NATO ally Turkey. \nTurkey is host to important U.S. and NATO military facilities. They include Incirlik Air Base, from which U.S. fighters and drones hit Islamic State in neighboring Syria, U.S. listening posts and an early warning radar for NATO’s European missile defense system. \n\"When it comes down to: Do we alienate the Turks, or do we alienate the Syrian Kurds, there's no doubt who's going to be the loser,\" said Bruce Riedel, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution and a former CIA analyst. \nThe United States is already walking on eggshells after accusations from Turkey that Washington was too slow to condemn last month's failed coup there. \nIn a sign of the sensitivities, the top U.S. military officer, General Joseph Dunford, called his Turkish counterpart on Sunday and Carter told the briefing he would see Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik next week. \nPresident Barack Obama will meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Sept. 4, the White House said. \n(Additional reporting by Idrees Ali, Yeganeh Torbati and Ruthy Munoz in Washington and Nick Tattersal in Istanbul; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Trending Stories",

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo By Jonathan Spicer | NEW YORK \nNEW YORK Six U.S. senators have urged President Barack Obama to prioritize cyber crime at this weekend's Group of 20 summit in China, in the wake of the theft of $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank, according to a letter obtained by Reuters. \nIn the letter sent to the White House ahead of the Sept. 4-5 summit, Sherrod Brown, a senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and five other Democratic senators say they want the U.S. president to press leaders from the world's 20 biggest economies to commit in joint communiques to a \"coordinated strategy to combat cyber-crime at critical financial institutions.\" \nThe letter, dated Monday, suggests that concern among U.S. lawmakers is growing over the February incident in which hackers breached Bangladesh Bank's systems and used the SWIFT banking network to request nearly $1 billion from an account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \nSome of the dozens of orders were filled, with much of the lost $81 million disappearing into Philippines casinos - prompting months of international finger-pointing, an ongoing investigation, and several requests from members of Congress for answers from the Fed and from SWIFT, the secure messaging service that banks use to transfer money around the world. \n\"Our financial institutions are connected in order to facilitate global commerce, but cyber criminals - whether independent or state-sponsored - imperil this international system in a way few threats have,\" the senators, headed by Gary Peters of Michigan, wrote in the letter to Obama. \n\"We strongly urge you to work with your counterparts and prioritize this discussion at the G20 leaders level in September,\" it said of the summit to be held in Hangzhou, China, adding that \"executive leadership circles across the globe\" needed to pay more attention to the risks. \nA senator in the Philippines has said Chinese hackers were likely to have pulled off the Bangladesh Bank heist, citing a network of Chinese people involved in the routing of the stolen funds through Manila. \nBeijing has dismissed the suggestion. \nCopies of the letter from the U.S. senators were also sent to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. \nOBAMA-XI TALKS \nThe other senators signing the letter were Mark Warner and Martin Heinrich, both members of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence; Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow, the ranking Democrat on the Senate's Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. \nThe White House expects G20 members at the summit \"to affirm their commitment to cooperate to fight cybercrime and to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy,\" a senior administration official said. \nAsked generally about cyber security on Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press conference: \"I would anticipate that this issue more generally will be on the agenda\" when Obama meets Chinese President Xi Jinping, the G20 summit host, later this week. \nAt a November summit, the G20 pledged not to conduct economically motivated cyber espionage, an agreement intended to reduce the estimated hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commercial trade secrets that are stolen by foreign governments seeking to benefit industry in their own countries. \nSince then, the Bangladesh Bank attack and others that have emerged are only some of the threats posed by cyber criminals, the senators wrote. World regulators should \"erect more robust defenses and collaborative systems to prevent and mitigate the impact of successful attacks,\" the letter said, noting that steps already taken by SWIFT are not enough. \nBangladesh said it supported raising the issue at G20. \n\"In most cases, cyber attacks and crimes take place from outside the country,\" said Ahmed Palak, a junior government minister for information and communications technology. \n\"So while addressing fast growing cyber attacks, there should be a coordinated approach involving global stakeholders.\" \nThe Fed and other U.S. regulators said in a letter last week they were focused on cyber risks and controls at banks in the wake of the Bangladesh incident, though they offered few specifics. \nPeters, a member of the Senate's Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, told Reuters he is considering requesting a committee hearing on the heist. \n\"I am concerned about the response and what steps have been taken to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said in an interview. \"You just need more collaboration and sharing of information... because often times all these entities aren't talking to each other.\" \n(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton and Dustin Volz in Washington and Serajul Quadir in Dhaka; Editing by Bernard Orr, Leslie Adler and Raju Gopalakrishnan) Trending Stories ",

JUST WATCHED Leahy defends previous remarks about SCOTUS nominees 03:59 Story highlights Joshua A. Douglas: Senate should vote on Merrick Garland's nomination to high court as soon as possible Key election rulings could be deadlocked if Supreme Court lacks a ninth justice, he says Joshua A. Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law specializing in election law, focuses on the constitutional right to vote, election administration and post-election disputes. He is the co-editor of a new book, \" Election Law Stories .\" Follow him on Twitter @JoshuaADouglas . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. A 'rigged' election in the Electoral College? (Opinion) (CNN) The Senate's failure to act on the US Supreme Court vacancy is already causing havoc for this year's election. It is time for the Senate to give Judge Merrick Garland -- whom President Barack Obama nominated way back in March -- a vote. Doing so might just save the election this November. In the past few weeks, courts around the country have issued rulings on voter ID laws. A federal court in Texas required \"softening\" of that state's strict photo ID requirement by making the state accept other forms of identification for voters who cannot easily obtain a state-mandated photo ID. But a different federal appeals court reversed a trial court's similar softening of Wisconsin's law, throwing out a lower court ruling that would allow voters to sign an affidavit to attest to their identity. Courts in North Carolina and North Dakota have also effectively invalidated those state's voter ID requirements. Appeals are pending. Joshua A. Douglas Meanwhile, litigation is ongoing on other important election law issues, such as early voting in Ohio and Wisconsin, voter roll purges in Ohio, gerrymandering in Maryland, monitoring long lines in Arizona and voter registration in Kansas. Yet the highest court in the land is unlikely to weigh in on these controversies or resolve any conflicts between the courts. And even if it does, there is a good chance that the court will deadlock 4-4. It takes a majority of the court to issue a binding ruling. After Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, the court was left with eight members -- four who tend to be more liberal and four who tend to be conservative. If the justices stick with their ideological predilections in an appeal of one of these cases, then the court will tie 4-4 (if the justices even agree to hear the case at all). A tie essentially affirms the lower court's decision, but without any binding effect for any future cases. Put differently, the court will say nothing, and the lower court's ruling will stand. Read More The result will be a patchwork of varying laws across the country on Election Day. This variation is already occurring: The federal appeals court in Texas required the state to ease up on Texas' ID law; the federal appeals court in Wisconsin required no similar exceptions. The Supreme Court will almost definitely not resolve the conflict between the cases. Supreme Court ruling weakens crucial protection for us all (Opinion) That is problematic for ensuring a well-functioning election. Inconsistent decisions and differing laws create difficulties for election administrators and breed voter confusion. Of course, the laws themselves vary slightly. But the fundamentals are the same: States are imposing strict voter ID requirements in the name of voter fraud, albeit without any proof whatsoever that in-person impersonation occurs to any significant degree in any election. The laws will likely disenfranchise valid voters -- at least in their strictest application before any judicial softening -- without providing any fraud-reducing benefit. It would better for the Supreme Court to say, once and for all, that to impose a barrier to the right to vote, a state must prove that the law will have some real-world effects in fixing an actual problem. Or, for the sake of finality, the court should provide the precise parameters under which a state may adopt a voter ID requirement. But saying nothing -- the likely outcome with an eight-member court -- helps no one. The problem will only worsen as the months go on. Key swing states, such as Ohio and Florida, are likely to see more litigation over their voting systems as the election nears. Ruth Bader Ginsburg's slam of Donald Trump In 2012, the Supreme Court issued four orders within weeks of the election in key states, reversing certain lower court decisions to maintain the pre-arranged election apparatus. The principle of these cases seems to be that courts should not issue last-minute rulings that change the status quo. One of those decisions (on Ohio's cutback of early voting) was a 5-4 ruling. With only eight justices, however, there is no judicial backstop, no final say, from the institution that is supposed to have the final say on legal questions. This could produce uncertainty as the election nears, especially if partisan-minded legislators continue to enact election laws intending to help their side. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This problem could be calamitous. If we have another post-election dispute such as Bush v. Gore, then the court could deadlock 4-4 . The result in Trump v. Clinton would then affirm whatever lower court heard the case -- likely a state supreme court. Most state supreme court justices are elected. Therefore, without a full bench on the US Supreme Court, the presidential election could come down to some elected judges in a swing state. That is no way to run a democracy. To be sure, many people view the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore as incorrect, but at least we had a judicial body that covers the entire country resolve the lingering dispute. This helped to provide finality and certainty. Clock running out on challenges to voting rights cases in key states This is not just an academic point. Donald Trump has strongly suggested he will not easily accept a defeat, raising the likelihood of a post-election challenge. The Senate should consider and vote on Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court as soon as possible and certainly before Election Day. It has been well over 150 days since Obama nominated Garland -- the longest wait of any Supreme Court nominee in history. This delay is not just concerning for the proper functioning of the Supreme Court and the rule of law. It is also problematic for the election as well. ",

REUTERS/Erik De Castro By Manuel Mogato | MANILA \nMANILA The number of drug-related killings in the Philippines since Rodrigo Duterte became president two months ago on a pledge to wipe out the illegal drug trade, has reached around 2,000, according to data released on Tuesday. \nThere has been popular support for his campaign, but the wave of killings unleashed since his election victory has alarmed rights groups and brought expressions of concern from the United States, a close ally of Manila. \nAs officials readied a publicity campaign to explain his fight against on narcotics, the Philippine National Police said that close to 900 drug traffickers and users had been killed in police operations from July 1 to August 20. That was an increase of 141 people over a week, on average 20 people a day. \nLast week the police said 1,100 other drug-related killings that were not classified as police operations were also being investigated. No new number for that category was given on Tuesday but, together with the new figure for police encounters, the total came to around 2,000. \nDuterte won the presidency of the Southeast Asian nation in a May election on a promise to wipe out drugs. \nTwo U.N. human rights experts recently urged the Philippines to stop extra-judicial killings, drawing a furious response from Duterte, who threatened to pull his country out of the United Nations. His foreign minister later rowed back on the threat. \nDuterte's communications secretary, Martin Andanar, said on Monday that a 30-second advertisement explaining the anti-drug campaign would be aired over the next week by commercial and public TV stations and by movie theaters. \n\"The government is not spending a single centavo on these ads and TV stations are carrying them for free,\" Andanar told reporters at an event in a Manila hotel. \n\"THIS IS A WAR\" \nHe said his office would also publish a 40-page pamphlet to explain the rising body count. This would be issued on the president's first trip abroad next week, first to Brunei and then to an East Asia summit in Laos. \n\"Some people abroad have to understand why many people are getting killed in the anti-drug campaign. They must understand, this is a war and there are casualties,\" Andanar said. \n\"The pamphlet will inform and explain that the government was not killing people at random, that these killings are not extrajudicial in nature but as part of the anti-crime campaign. Some of those killed were police officers who are involved in criminal activities.\" \nThe White House said on Monday that U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet Duterte in Laos on Sept. 6, and plans to touch on human rights as well as security concerns. \nDuterte's crackdown on drugs and some strongly worded criticism he has made of the United States present a dilemma for Washington, which has been seeking to forge unity among allies and partners in Asia in the face of an increasingly assertive China, especially in the strategic South China Sea. \nThere have been few signs in the Philippines itself of a backlash against the war on drugs. \nHowever, on Tuesday a newly formed group called the \"Stop the Killings Network\" announced a #Lightforlife campaign that would start with simultaneous candle-lighting events on Wednesday evening at six venues across Manila. \n(Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Richard Balmforth) Trending Stories",

	      "text": "Tweet Share BEIJING (Reuters) - An American businesswoman held in China since March last year has been charged with spying, China's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, the latest development in a case that has added to U.S.-China tensions. Sandy Phan-Gillis, from Houston, Texas, who is of Chinese ancestry and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested in March 2015 and had been held without charges since then. \"Based on our understanding, Phan-Gillis, because of her suspected crimes of espionage, has been charged according to law by the relevant Chinese department,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular briefing. \"China is a country ruled by law. The relevant Chinese department will handle the case strictly according to law,\" she said, without elaborating. It was unclear what violations the charge covers. The government has chided the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for saying her detention violated international human rights norms. Her husband, Jeff Gillis, said in a statement the \"charges are absolutely false,\" and called on China to release his wife. He said the charges include an accusation that his wife went on a spy mission to China in 1996. Her passport at that time shows that she made no trip to China that year, he said. The U.S. State Department has urged China to resolve the case \"expeditiously.\" The charge comes amid heightened tensions in U.S.-China relations, dogged by issues ranging from territorial disputes in the South China Sea to the sentencing in the United States of a Chinese national for conspiracy to hack sensitive military information. The Chinese man, Su Bin, 51, was sent to prison for 46 months in July after pleading guilty to conspiring to hack into the computer networks of major U.S. defense contractors. U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in China on Saturday for a G20 summit in the city of Hangzhou. Phan-Gillis had said in a letter transcribed by a U.S. consular official in China that her detention was because of politics and not for any crime. She visited China on a trade delegation from Houston and was detained while attempting to cross from the southern city of Zhuhai to Macau. Her husband has said she is not a spy or a thief. China's state secret law is extremely broad, encompassing everything from industrial data to top leaders' birthdays. Information can also be declared a state secret retroactively. There is no independent oversight of China's law enforcement authorities or courts, which answer to the ruling Communist Party.

	      "text": "President Obama to guest edit Wired by Seth Fiegerman @sfiegerman   Take a VR trip to Yosemite National Park What else can you possibly add to your resume after serving as president of the United States? Magazine editor, apparently. \nPresident Obama will guest edit the November issue of Wired, which the magazine is touting as the first time a magazine has been edited by a sitting president. \nThe issue, scheduled to come out in October, will focus on \"the next hurdles that humanity will need to overcome to move forward,\" according to an announcement Tuesday from Wired. \n\"These will include personal frontiers, from precision medicine to human performance; local frontiers, including using data in urban planning and making sure renewable energy works for everyone; national frontiers, from civil rights to medical data,\" Robert Capps, head of editorial at Wired, wrote in the announcement. \nIt will also include \"international frontiers, like climate change and cybersecurity; and final frontiers, including space travel and Artificial Intelligence,\" according to Capps. \nRelated: Obama's staff is taking over Silicon Valley \nThe announcement comes just days after Wired endorsed Hillary Clinton , marking the magazine's first presidential endorsement in its 23-year history. \nClinton won Wired's praise for supporting net neutrality, pledging to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, and aiming to make immigration easier for people with STEM degrees. Barack Obama ( @POTUS ) will serve as guest editor of WIRED's November issue. https://t.co/bzw9WNgK54 #WIREDxPOTUS pic.twitter.com/OeGL84Uz8k — WIRED (@WIRED) August 30, 2016 \nThe Obama administration has been particularly cozy with the technology industry that Wired covers. \nDozens of Obama staffers have left for jobs at companies like Google ( GOOG ) , Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) , Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) and Uber -- and executives from some of these companies have also taken technology roles in the Obama administration. \nObama, like Clinton, has pushed for issues supported by Wired and the tech community, including entrepreneurship and the need for immigration reform for skilled workers. \nObama has even suggested he may be interested in doing some work as a venture capitalist after leaving office.

	      "text": "Down Ticket is Yahoo News’ complete guide to the most fascinating House, Senate and governors’ races of 2016. Coming to you every Tuesday and Thursday until Nov. 8. What you need to know today. \nHappy Florida Primary Day! Here are four storylines to watch as the results come rolling in. If we had to pick just one state to watch for the rest of this election cycle, Florida would be it.\nForget about the marquee slugfest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. As\n“SNL’s” Stefon might say, the Sunshine State’s down-ballot races have everything :\n– A former GOP White House candidate, Marco Rubio, who solemnly vowed not to run for reelection to the Senate this year — then decided to do it anyway.\n– A Democratic Senate primary between a guy who has been accused of padding his résumé (Rep. Patrick Murphy) and a guy who has been accused of abusing his now ex-wife (Rep. Alan Grayson).\n– A race for the latter’s U.S. House seat that features both his current wife, Dena Grayson, and one of his top congressional aides, Susannah Randolph.\n– A Democratic congresswoman, Corrine Brown, who is running for reelection while simultaneously being tried in a federal corruption case .\n– Another Democratic House contest that pits a former candidate for lieutenant governor, Annette Taddeo, against her close friend and mentor, Joe Garcia. Garcia is a former congressman whose chief of staff was sent to jail in 2013 for orchestrating a fraudulent ballot scheme .\n– A former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, who is now running for the House as a Democrat .\n– And a recently dethroned chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, fighting for her political life against a nationwide movement of disgruntled progressives — including her party’s 2016 presidential runner-up, Bernie Sanders.\nNot to mention the fact that 24 of the state’s 27 congressional districts were redrawn last year after the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the old map was unconstitutional.\nIt’s basically the electoral version of the Florida Man meme, except with serious implications for control of Congress and the political direction of the nation as a whole.\nOh, and the Sunshine State’s primaries are today — meaning the fall campaigns are about to begin in earnest. If you haven’t tuned in yet, now is the time.\nHere are four storylines to watch — all of them with national implications — as Floridians go to the polls.\n1. Can anyone else pull a Trump? \nDonald Trump may have defeated Marco Rubio by a dizzying 19 percentage points in Florida’s March 15 presidential primary — even though Rubio is a Florida native who has held elected office in the state, in one capacity or another, for nearly 15 years. But that doesn’t mean Trump’s signature blend of hard-edged nativism and politically incorrect bomb-throwing is producing the same sort of results for Republicans who aren’t Donald Trump. \nQuite the opposite, actually.\nTake Carlos Beruff. When Rubio reversed himself and entered the Florida Senate race at the last minute — literally two days before the June 22 deadline — most of the other GOP candidates dutifully stepped aside.\nView photos \nCarlos Beruff announcing his candidacy in February. (Photo: Giorgio Viera/El Nuevo Herald/TNS via Getty Images) More Not Beruff. Instead, the wealthy Manatee County developer doubled down on his Donald impression, cutting attack ads that claim Rubio isn’t as tough as Trump; proposing a ban on all Middle Eastern immigrants (except Israelis); and tweeting stuff like “I won’t read a bunch of crap off a teleprompter.” He even parrots one of Trump’s catchphrases: “ it’s time to put America first .” The Miami New Times called Beruff “the Cuban-American Donald Trump”; Roll Call labeled him “Little Trump of Florida.”\nThe only problem? Beruff is going to lose on Tuesday — by a lot. The latest polls show him trailing Rubio by 30 to 60 points.\nIt’s a result that, along with similar outcomes in various other contests, “casts serious doubt on the existence of Trumpism minus Trump,” writes Frank Bruni .\nOr, at the very least, it casts serious doubt on the existence of Trumpism minus a candidate who’s already famous in his or her right. So far, the lesson of this cycle is that if you’re a Beruff or a Paul Nehlen — Paul Ryan’s unsuccessful primary challenger — and you’re running against an incumbent as well-known as Rubio or Ryan, then you’re going to lose every time.\nIn other words, the usual laws of politics still apply — no matter how slavishly you imitate the Donald.\n2. Are Democrats blowing their big opportunity? \nLast Thursday, the New York Times published a story headlined “ Democrats’ Weak Bench Undermines Hope of Taking Back Senate .”\n“Senate Democrats, aware of the dead weight that Donald J. Trump has placed on their vulnerable Republican colleagues, can taste a reclaimed majority,” it began. “But just as Senate Republicans blew their chances in 2010 and 2012 before finally taking control in 2014, Democrats find themselves hobbled by less-than-stellar candidates in races that could make the difference in winning a majority.”\nFlorida may be one of those races.\nThe primary between Orlando Rep. Alan Grayson and Treasure Coast Rep. Patrick Murphy has been one of the nastiest in recent Florida history — and that’s saying something. Grayson has called Murphy a “dishonest” “Republican sock puppet” and slammed him for “ inflating his résumé, for asking state officials to delay an announcement about the opening of a center to assist businesses affected by a toxic algae bloom, and for voting with Republicans on key issues .”\nMeanwhile, Murphy has repeatedly dismissed and disparaged Grayson, a left-wing firebrand, after allegations of a two-decade pattern of domestic abuse surfaced in Politico last month .\nView photos \nPatrick Murphy and Alan Grayson (Photos: Steve Cannon/AP) More Not that the confrontational, bombastic Grayson — a pol who once described a lobbyist as a “K Street whore”; who has accused Republicans of wanting Americans to “die quickly”; and who is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for running his hedge fund while in office — was particularly popular with mainstream Democrats before that. Both Barack Obama and Joe Biden have taken the unusual step of endorsing Murphy, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has publicly told Grayson, “ I want you to lose .”\nMurphy leads Grayson by a wide margin in the latest polls and is likely to win Tuesday — even as he trails Rubio in every survey released since the incumbent inserted himself into the race .\nSometimes rocky primaries strengthen candidates. But that doesn’t seem to have been the case with Murphy (who is also being hounded by Republicans for receiving hefty financial support from his rich father at every stage of his career ).\n“It’s highly bitter and highly personal,” Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida, recently told the Orlando Sentinel . “It parallels what you see on every level, and it’s why so many people are tired of this election. The tone is just wearing on people.”\nEven more worrisome for Democrats than the timbre of this particular contest is the likelihood that it won’t be the last of its kind.\nIn the New York Times, Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor and Senate analyst for the Cook Political Report, predicted that as Bernie Sanders-inspired progressives continue to challenge establishment favorites like Murphy, “Democrats are going to have their own  Tea Party  moment in 2018.” And with Republicans now controlling 68 of 98 partisan state legislative chambers, the highest number in GOP history, the Democratic bench is thinner than ever before — which means that Murphy won’t be the last flawed candidate the party is forced to support.\n3. Can Bernie defeat Debbie? \nSpeaking of Sanders, voters in Florida’s 23 rd Congressional District will finally decide Tuesday whether to heed the senator’s call to sack the controversial Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nSanders has been at war with the former Democratic National Committee chair for months, first accusing her of rigging the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton and then, in the wake of last month’s DNC email hack, leading the charge that led to her resignation from the party’s top post. All along, he’s been ginning up support for Wasserman Schultz’s challenger, a law professor named Tim Canova, via his powerful email list and fundraising operation.\nView photos \nTim Canova joins union members at a Verizon protest in May. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images) More So far, Canova has received $3.8 million in Sanders-driven donations, even as Sanders himself has declined to stump for Canova in person.\nAll that money and proxy-war publicity have transformed Canova into a more credible challenger than anyone expected. But he still trails Wasserman Schultz by 10 percentage points in a heavily Jewish area where Clinton clobbered Sanders with more than 70 percent of the vote — and where Wasserman Schultz has won every election since 1992.\nCanova is unlikely to break that streak Tuesday — suggesting that however popular Sanders was on a presidential level, he still has a long way to go before he “revolutionizes” the Democratic Party.\n4. Will turnout change the game? \nThere’s still a chance, however, that Canova — and other legislative candidates across the state — could shock observers with upset victories this week.\nWhy? A fascinating new turnout trend. Ace Florida political reporter Adam Smith has the details :\n\nAlmost half of the mail ballots returned so far for Tuesday’s primary election have come from Floridians who voted in either one or zero of the past four primary elections. That means a big, decisive chunk of the vote will come from people who have not been polled, and potentially not courted, targeted or accounted for by countless campaigns across the state. … \nAs of Thursday morning, more than 855,000 primary ballots had been cast by mail. More than a quarter of those votes came from Floridians who had not voted in the last four primaries and another 20 percent from people who voted in just one of the last four primaries. \nIn other words, these are not “likely voters” surveyed by most pollsters or targeted by sophisticated political campaigns. The trend applies to Democrats and Republicans alike and across the state. \nDriven by the new ease of absentee voting — Floridians now automatically receive ballots — and widespread frustration with the presidential clash between Trump and Clinton, voters who declined to participate in earlier primaries are suddenly weighing in. That could render some preprimary polling inaccurate and produce surprise results in any number of close races.\nCanova, for one, is counting on it. “Our ground game is so big” — four field offices, 40 paid staffers, hundreds of volunteers — “that we’ve really expanded the field,” he recently told NBC News .\nView photos \nA voter hands in his absentee ballot. (Photo: Alan Diaz/AP) More “This is huge,” said Marian Johnson, senior vice president of political strategy for the Florida Chamber of Commerce (the first group to notice the uptick in unlikely voters). “I can envision election night when the votes are counted that certain people win that nobody thought had a chance, and that being attributed to this trend.”\nIn a state with more competitive House races than anywhere except for California or New York — including what promises to be a fierce battle in Florida’s 26 th Congressional District between endangered GOP incumbent Carlos Curbelo and whoever wins Tuesday’s Democratic primary between former Rep. Joe Garcia and his mentee, Annette Taddeo — upsets Tuesday could either help or hinder the Democratic Party’s long-shot campaign to recapture control of the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nMeanwhile in Arizona… Florida isn’t the only state that’s holding its primaries today; Arizona is also heading to the polls.\nThis year’s marquee battle is the GOP Senate primary pitting five-term incumbent John McCain against former state Sen. Kelli Ward. McCain’s relationship with the state GOP has been tempestuous; in 2014, the state party formally censured him for breaking with conservatives on key issues, calling his record “disastrous and harmful.” Polls taken around the same time showed that more Arizona Republicans disapproved (55 percent) than approved (35 percent) of his performance in office.\nView photos \nKelli Ward, right, who is running against Sen. John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary, talks to voters. (Photo: Ross D. Franklin/AP) More Ward embodies the right’s dissatisfaction with McCain. A 47-year-old doctor of osteopathic medicine, she has taken a Trumpian approach to the incumbent, slamming him as a pro-immigrant, pro-war creature of the establishment who is virtually indistinguishable from Hillary Clinton . Ward has even suggested that McCain, 80, might die in office.\n“I’m a doctor,” Ward told Politico. “The life expectancy of the American male is not 86. It’s less.”\n(Fun fact: Ward is correct if you measure life expectancy at birth, averaging in all the people who die young, but as FactCheck.org points out , an American male who is already 80 can be expected to live another eight years.)\nThe race is closer than analysts expected it to be — and McCain isn’t taking anything for granted . Still, barring a stunning upset, McCain should win — though perhaps by single digits, which would be the closest margin of his career. Bruised, the senator would then proceed to his second tough race of the year: a general election contest against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a well-funded, well-prepared Democrat.\nAnd he would still have to deal with Donald Trump.\nTrump has dogged McCain all year. The senator technically supports his party’s nominee, though in the most tepid terms imaginable; Trump, meanwhile, has insulted McCain at every turn. As a result, Ward is attacking McCain for being insufficiently gung-ho about the Donald — and therefore insufficiently conservative — and Kirkpatrick is saying that a true maverick would never bow before a guy who once mocked his heroic service in Vietnam .\nIt’s a rock-and-a-hard-place situation for McCain, and one that will likely persist through Nov. 8; the senator has promised that he won’t turn on Trump in the general.\n“No, there’s no reason to do that,” McCain said last week . “They all know me. Everybody in Arizona really knows me unless they just moved in.”\nView photos \nSen. John McCain and his wife, Cindy, leave a polling station after voting on Tuesday. (Photo: Matt York/AP) More On to the House. To run against McCain, Kirkpatrick had to vacate her seat in Arizona’s 1 st Congressional District, which runs from Flagstaff to the northern Tucson suburbs. The contest to replace her is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country. Democrat Tom O’Halleran is expected to easily win Tuesday’s Democratic primary, but no less than five Republicans — Springerville rancher and businessman Gary Kiehne, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, Retired Air Force pilot Wendy Rogers, Navajo Nation businessman Shawn Redd — are battling to face off against him in November. Arizona’s 1 st District is one of only three Democratic-held House tossups this year , so whoever wins Tuesday will have the rare chance to pick up a seat for the GOP.\nArizona’s 2 nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Tucson and Cochise County, is also worth watching. There, Democrats Matt Heinz and Victoria Steele are vying to challenge incumbent U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, a first-term Republican who won by a mere 167 votes in 2014.\n\nThe best of the rest DSCC (+D Super PAC) delay ad spending on Ohio Senate race https://t.co/4srHCqLJUo #OHSEN \n— Michael LaRosa (@MichaelLaRosaDC) August 30, 2016 \n\n\nMcCain explains why he will keep supporting, and criticizing, Donald Trump.

	      "text": "The first commercial flights from the US to Cuba are resuming Some lawmakers are worried about security at Cuban airports Santa Clara, Cuba (CNN) When Jet Blue flight 387 touches down in Cuba on Wednesday, it will be the first direct commercial flight between the US and the island in over a half-century. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Santa Clara, Cuba, flight is the latest symbol of the thawing of relations between the former Cold War adversaries, who restored diplomatic ties in 2015. Until now, Santa Clara was most famous for being the site of the tomb of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, the Argentine revolutionary who fought alongside Fidel Castro and was later killed with the help of the CIA while leading an insurrection in Bolivia. Soon up to a maximum of 110 daily flights operated by such carriers as Jet Blue, American Airlines, Delta, Frontier, Southwest and Silver Airways are due to begin flying to the Communist-run island, according to the US Department of Transportation. Although the Obama administration has eased restrictions on travel to Cuba, there is still a travel ban for Americans visiting the island. Read More Tourism to Cuba is still illegal, but there are now 12 categories of \"authorized travel .\" Before US citizens can board flights to Cuba, they willneed to sign an affidavit swearing their travel falls within the permitted categories, including educational, religious and humanitarian reasons. With the relaxing of the travel ban, Cuba has seen a spike in US visitors: about 93,000, or nearly double from the year before, according to Cuban tourism officials. Despite the increase, Cuban officials say the embargo, or the \"blockade\" as they refer to US sanctions, must be lifted before there is full freedom of travel between the two countries. \"This process of establishing regular flights is a positive step,\" said Eduardo Rodríguez, the Cuban Vice Minister of Transportation at a news conference on Monday in Havana.\"Although the restrictions of the blockade remain, which among other things impede United States citizens from traveling to our country as tourists.\" Rodríguez said US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx would travel to the island on Wednesday to mark the historic occasion of the first direct commercial flight. More than 50 years of no commercial flights Until Fidel Castro's revolution in 1959, Cuba had been a favorite vacation spot for Americans in the Caribbean. But in 1961, after Castro declared his government to be in the Socialist camp, diplomatic relations were severed and direct commercial fight service disrupted. \"Castro cracks down on flights from Cuba,\" reads a UPI wire service headline from the era. During the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, US carriers were briefly banned from flying over the island and the Cuban military shot down a U2 spy plane, killing the pilot.

Hide Caption 19 of 19 For the decades that followed, the only US aircrafts that traveled to the island were the result of frequent hijackings. In 2001, a change in US regulations allowed Cuban Americans to visit family on the island and for charter flights to begin to travel between the two countries. Cuban officials say that since then they have coordinated closely with their American counterparts and are ready for the US carriers to return. \"In relation to aviation security, we have been working with the US government for about 15 years. This isn't new,\" said Alfredo Cordero, the president of the Cuban Civil Aviation Institute. \"Cuba gives the maximum attention to this aspect of aviation security and we have achieved the training of personnel and the necessary resources to obtain the security that's required by the International Civil Aviation Organizations.\" Concerns about security But not everyone is celebrating the resumed flight service. Rep. John Katko, a New York Republican, said the flights pose a risk to US security. \"TSA has not come close to doing a thorough security assessment of the airports in Cuba,\" he said, referring the Transportation Security Administration. Katko and two other lawmakers introduced legislation earlier this summer in an effort to block the flights to Cuba until they felt certain Cuban airport security could effectively prevent terrorists from targeting US-bound flights. They were unsuccessful in stopping the flights, but Katko told CNN he remains concerned about how the Cuban Civil Aviation authority will prevent insider threats, meaning airport workers who may conspire to target a US-bound aircraft. \"I just think its dangerous and, again, I'm not saying anything bad is going to happen, but we just got to do our due diligence and we are just not doing it,\" he said. The TSA said the agency has inspected Cuban airports and found they comply with international standards. In an email to CNN, agency spokesman Michael England said, \"TSA has assessed eight of the ten airports and will complete the final two before flights commence at those locations.\" When asked about the lack of high-tech screening machines, England responded, \"Technology is only one element of a security system that is multi-layered and involves people, processes and technology. TSA has sent teams of TSA inspectors on a regular basis to Cuba to assess airports currently operating as last points of departure to ensure compliance with international standards\" set out by the International aviation arm of the United Nations, ICAO. Over the summer, Cuban airports adopted US security requirements like requiring passengers traveling to the US to remove their shoes and leave liquids at checkpoints. JUST WATCHED ",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences of 111 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his second round of clemency grants this month, the White House said on Tuesday. Obama has now granted a total of 673 commutations during his presidency, more than the number granted by the 10 previous presidents combined, as he seeks to reform the criminal justice system, it said.\nFor some of the convicts, the commutations mean they will serve only half of their original prison sentences. For instance, Sly Stallone Aikens of South Carolina, serving a sentence of 360 months for using and carrying a gun during a drug trafficking crime, will now serve only 180 months.\nMore than one-third of the 673 convicts had been serving life sentences.\nObama has made reducing the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses a priority. It is one of the rare issues where the president gets support from Republican lawmakers.\nHe launched the clemency program in 2014, inviting thousands of drug offenders and others to seek early release. It was the most ambitious such program in 40 years, but it has struggled under a flood of thousands of unprocessed cases.\nThe White House counsel, Neil Eggleston, said he expects Obama will continue to grant commutations through the end of his presidency, which ends on Jan. 20. But only legislation passed by Congress can \"achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure our federal sentencing system operates more fairly and effectively,\" Eggleston said.\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner and Ayesha Rascoe; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jonathan Oatis)",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama cut short on Tuesday the sentences of 111 federal inmates in another round of commutations for those convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug convictions, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.\nWhite House Counsel Neil Eggleston said the commutations underscored the president's commitment to using his clemency authority to give deserving individuals a second chance. He said that Obama has granted a total of 673 commutations, more than the previous 10 presidents combined. More than a third of the recipients were serving life sentences.\n\"We must remember that these are individuals — sons, daughters, parents, and in many cases, grandparents — who have taken steps toward rehabilitation and who have earned their second chance,\" Eggleston said. \"They are individuals who received unduly harsh sentences under outdated laws for committing largely nonviolent drug crimes.\"\nEggleston noted that Obama also granted commutation to 214 federal inmates earlier in the month. With Tuesday's additions, Obama has granted the greatest number of commutations for a single month of any president.\nEggleston says he expects Obama to continue using his clemency authority through the end of his administration. He said the relief points to the need for Congress to take up criminal justice reform. Such legislation has stalled, undercut by a rash of summer shootings involving police and the pressure of election-year politics.\nTwo goals of the legislation are to reduce overcrowding in the nation's prisons and save taxpayer dollars. In 1980, the federal prison population was less than 25,000. Today, it is more than 200,000.\nBut the legislation's supporters have encountered opposition from some Republicans who argue that changes could lead to an increase in crime and pose a greater danger to law enforcement.\nEggleston said Obama considered the individual merits of each application to determine that an applicant is ready to make use of their second chance.\nOne of those granted relief was Tim Tyler, who at 25 was sentenced to life in federal prison for possession with intent to deliver LSD as he followed the Grateful Dead. He is now set to be released on August 30, 2018, conditioned upon enrollment in residential drug treatment. Families Against Mandatory Minimums, an advocacy group, said it had been working on the Tyler family's behalf.\n\"We applaud the president for using the clemency power to free people who fully expected to die in prison and for shining a light on the excesses of federal drug sentencing.\" said Julie Stewart, the group's president.\nThe release dates for the inmates vary. Most are set to be released December 28.\nLegal groups supporting the president's actions have formed an organization called Clemency Project 2014 that has submitted some 1,600 clemency petitions to the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney. The group said a prisoner must have served at least 10 years of his or her sentence to be considered for a commutation grant and must be a non-violent offender without significant ties to gangs or cartels. The inmate also must have demonstrated good conduct in prison while serving a sentence that likely would have been substantially lower if handed out today.\n\"We are looking forward to many more grants during the remaining months of President Obama's term in office,\" said the group's project manager, Cynthia Roseberry.\n____\nOn Twitter, reach Kevin Freking at https://twitter.com/APkfreking",

	      "text": "Philippines' drug war hits 2000 deaths By Manuel Mogato - AAP on August 31, 2016, 9:06 am The number of drug-related killings since the new Filipino president was elected has reached 2000. Share Philippines drug war hits 2000 deaths - Yahoo7 The number of drug-related killings in the Philippines since Rodrigo Duterte became president two months ago on a pledge to wipe out the illegal drug trade, has reached around 2000. \nThere has been popular support for his campaign, but the wave of killings unleashed since his election victory has alarmed rights groups and brought expressions of concern from the United States, a close ally of Manila. \nAs officials readied a publicity campaign to explain his fight against on narcotics, the Philippine National Police said that close to 900 drug traffickers and users had been killed in police operations from July 1 to August 20. \nThat was an increase of 141 people over a week, on average 20 people a day. \nLast week the police said 1100 other drug-related killings that were not classified as police operations were also being investigated. \nNo new number for that category was given on Tuesday but, together with the new figure for police encounters, the total came to around 2000. \nDuterte won the presidency of the Southeast Asian nation in a May election on a promise to wipe out drugs. \nTwo UN human rights experts recently urged the Philippines to stop extra-judicial killings, drawing a furious response from Duterte, who threatened to pull his country out of the United Nations. \nDuterte's communications secretary, Martin Andanar, said on Monday that an advertisement explaining the anti-drug campaign would air next week. \nHe said his office would also publish a pamphlet to explain the rising body count. \nThis would be issued on the president's first trip abroad next week, first to Brunei and then to an East Asia summit in Laos. \nThe White House said on Monday that U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet Duterte in Laos on September 6, and plans to touch on human rights as well as security concerns.

	      "text": "Pollution, residents cleared out in preparation for China's big G20 debut in Hangzhou China wants to focus on economic issues, rather than the South China Sea dispute (CNN) World leaders touch down in the Chinese city of Hangzhou this week for the G20 summit and Beijing is determined it will proceed without a hitch. Factories are shuttered, skies are clear and security is tight. Local residents have been given seven days extra vacation time and discounted tours to destinations outside the city to ensure Hangzhou is free of crowds and traffic. Meanwhile, thousands of migrant workers have left the city due to the halt in their work lives and the growing inconvenience caused by G20 preparation measures. What will be discussed at the summit? How has China prepared? And why is it in Hangzhou anyway? Here's five things you need to know. Read More China takes the lead The Hangzhou meeting will be the first G20 China has hosted, and only the second held in Asia since 2008. The G20's first high-profile meeting was in Washington D.C. in 2008 , after the fall of Lehman Brothers bank and the start of the global financial crisis. Photos: China's best public bike system – While the rest of the country is moving from two wheels to four, cycling culture is thriving in Hangzhou. The city has the world's biggest public bike system, offering more than 84,000 bicycles for rent. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: West Lake – A stroll along the 12,000-acre West Lake in Hangzhou city center is all it takes to understand why the city is called \"paradise on earth.\" Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Mountain getaways – About 40 kilometers away from the city center, Qiandai Resort sits on Jing Mountain. The low-profile resort doesn't have a website, though it does have a WeChat account (China's version of Whatsapp/Facebook). Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Zen – Surrounded by lush trees, Lingyin Temple is a pocket of calm a short ride from the city center. It's one of the country's oldest and most important Buddhist monasteries. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Silk – Hangzhou is known as the city of silk. Scarves are the city's most popular silk souvenir, highlighting its cutting-edge dyeing techniques. The industry leader is Wensli , a homegrown silk brand. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Longjing tea – Hangzhou is home to some of China's finest -- and priciest -- tea leaves. The village of Longjing is where tea leaves were grown for China's ancient emperor. Tea-picking season is usually around late March to April, when travelers from across the country visit the village for quality tea leaves. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Hangzhou cuisine – Unlike dishes from northern China, heavy in sauces and spices, Hangzhou cuisine -- also known as Hangbang cai -- is mild but flavorful with a focus on fresh ingredients. Longjing shrimp is Hangzhou's signature dish. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Alibaba – Nicknamed China's Silicon Valley, Hangzhou is home to Jack Ma, the founder and chairman of Alibaba Group and the second-richest man in China. Alibaba, the world's leading e-commerce group, has transformed Ma's hometown into a high-tech metropolis. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: China Art Academy – Hangzhou's China Art Academy has seen some of the country's most celebrated Chinese artists pass through its halls. The head of its architecture school, Wang Shu, brought home China's first Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2012. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Fans – It's said that tea, silk and hand fans are Hangzhou's three unparalleled gifts. The most iconic fans are by Wang Xing Ji. Established in 1875, this time-honored brand has charmed tourists and locals alike with its intricately designed fans. Hide Caption 10 of 10 An alternative to the more exclusive G7, it was designed as a way to create conversation at the top levels of international government and try to ensure disasters, like the financial crisis, were avoided in the future. The Hangzhou summit has been called another \"milestone\" for a rising China, keen to show its growing dominance on the world stage. It's an opportunity for President Xi Jinping to burnish his diplomatic credentials. He'll meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and it will likely be his last bilateral meeting with US President Barack Obama. No effort spared China is not taking any chances with the showpiece event -- Hangzhou is in \"virtual lockdown,\" according to CNN's Andrew Stevens, in the lead-up to the arrival of world leaders on Friday. A security checkpoint at the West Lake scenic spot in Hangzhou. Police officers and security guards will be stationed every five to 10 meters at popular attractions like the city's West Lake, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. \"Security is tight and getting tighter,\" Stevens said, adding his camera crew were stopped multiple times and asked for their credentials. One migrant worker told CNN that authorities had confiscated the gas tank his family uses for cooking, saying it didn't meet safety standards. \"Ordinary people suffer. It's really affected our daily lives,\" said Xu, who didn't want to give his full name. Hangzhou: Innovation capital? Hangzhou wasn't just chosen to host the G20 because of its natural beauty -- it's also symbolic as a marker of China's transition from a low-cost manufacturer to high-tech economy. E-commerce group Alibaba, one of China's largest companies and most successful start-ups, was founded in Hangzhou, the hometown of founder Jack Ma. Alipay -- Alibaba's mobile payment application -- has changed the way Chinese people shop. Chinese residents can easily get by without a wallet as the app allows them to pay bills with a simple swipe of their smart phones -- even at the smallest street restaurants and vegetable vendors. \"We're pretty small city, only have close to nine million people but Hangzhou is so powerful, so influential to China's economy, to China's culture,\" Ma told Alibaba's news services Alizila. President Xi has a history with the city as well -- he lived in Hangzhou for five years while serving as the province's Communist Party chief and is said to be fond of his time there. 10 things Hangzhou does best G20 blue Hangzhou is renowned as one of China's most beautiful cities, but, like many places in China, it struggles with pollution, ranking 43 out of 74 cities in a 2014 study by Greenpeace. But in the lead-up to the G20, the sky has cleared as polluting industries have been shut down or moved for the international meeting's duration. Some 225 factories have been ordered to close and traffic will also be restricted,with half the city's vehicles barred from roads from August 28. The China Daily said an upper limit of PM2.5 particles, one of the worst pollutants, was set at 35 micrograms per cubic meter during the summit. The average PM2.5 level in Hangzhou in 2014 was 66.1. Nearby cities of Huangshan, Anqing, Yiwu and even Shanghai are also cleaning up their factories, according to Chinese media. It's a pattern seen before other big ticket events. In 2014, Beijing residents coined the wry phrase \"APEC blue\" after authorities went all out to ensure clear skies before the powwow of Asia Pacific leaders and last September the skies turned \"parade blue\" as Beijing hosted a massive military parade. Images taken from CNN's Beijing bureau on November 6, when the sky was blue during the APEC summit, and on November 19 when the smog returned. The elephant in the room? It's been less than three months since China lost to the Philippines in an international court case over its contested territorial claims in the South China Sea. But at the G20 in Hangzhou, the host country will be working hard to keep it off the agenda. Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong said it will be focusing on economic issues, according to government mouthpiece China Daily , rather than security. In a separate editorial, the Global Times wrote the Hangzhou summit \"shouldn't be distracted by sea spat.\" Journalist Shen Lu and CNN's Andrew Stevens contributed to this report ",

	      "text": "Posted on August 30, 2016 by Editor - Political News \n  TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy each easily won their primaries Tuesday, setting up a November showdown that’s guaranteed to be nasty as each party grapples for a majority in the Senate. Rubio, who decided at the last second to seek a second term, easily fended off millionaire homebuilder Carlos Beruff and Murphy used the backing of President Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders to defeat U.S. Rep Alan Grayson, who was counting on his party’s most faithful liberal voters to overcome Murphy’s money and establishment support. In other contests, former Democrat Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was hoping to keep her seat in Congress against Tim Canova, a Bernie Sanders-backed law professor who was able to raises more than $3 million. Rubio had declared during his failed presidential campaign that he would not run again for Senate. But he nearly cleared what had been a crowded GOP field with his last-minute turnabout. Beruff rolled the dice to see if the anti-establishment mood powering Donald Trump’s presidential campaign could send him to Washington as well. But after spending $8 million of his own money and going nowhere in the polls, he essentially shut down his campaign ahead of the primary. Rubio supporters at his party near Walt Disney World whooped and chanted “Marco! Marco! Marco!” when The Associated Press declared him the winner. “I voted for Marco only because I’ve been a longstanding supporter,” said Diane Martin-Johnson, 66, after voting early Tuesday in Pinellas Park. “It’s unfortunate he didn’t do his job fully in Washington this term. I do think he deserves another chance. He thought he was doing the right thing (by running for president). That’s my only complaint against him. He’s a good man.” Murphy, a former Republican, quickly earned party support and raised significantly more money. He was also backed by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Grayson, a fiery liberal known for brash comments and hamstrung by a difficult divorce, relied mostly on small donors and feuded with party leaders. Todd Martin, 53, and his 18-year-old daughter Haley, voted together in Tallahassee, where they recently moved as she starts college. They both chose Murphy, in part because they like his efforts to get government to address algae outbreaks near their former home in Vero Beach. “I grew up on the river and it’s a shame what they let happen,” Todd Martin said. “I like where Patrick Murphy stands on the algae. It’s very important to me.” Secretary of State Ken Detzner said there were slight delays in opening some polling places, but described no other glitches. More than 1.75 million Floridians already cast ballots by mail or at early-voting stations before polls opened Tuesday. This year’s primary turnout could top ones held in 2012 and 2014— a sign that competitive races for Congress and the Florida Legislature could be driving up turnout this time around. Rubio and Murphy took opposite approaches on primary day. Rubio had no public events scheduled before polls closed, while Murphy began his day at 7 a.m. at a Miami-Dade polling site, joined by Gov. Bob Graham, a former senator, and his daughter, U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham. Murphy also visited two other South Florida polling sites. Wasserman Schultz jumped to an early lead over Canova in a primary colored by leaked emails revealing that DNC officials had worked against Sanders to favor Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Democrats also hope to gain seats in Florida’s heavily Republican House delegation after court-mandated redistricting chipped away the advantages of some incumbents. Florida had to rip up and redraw its congressional maps after they were found to violate the state constitution’s provision requiring compact districts that don’t favor incumbents or political parties. That spurred one of the state’s most heavily contested congressional election years. Several races will essentially be decided in the primary and Florida will eventually send at least seven new House members to Washington. Republicans now outnumber Democrats 17-10 in the state’s congressional delegation. If Democrats sweep all four seats seen as competitive in November, that Republican advantage could be reduced to 14-13. One of those is now held by U.S. Rep. David Jolly, a Republican who was expected to win Tuesday, but who would then have to beat former Gov. Charlie Crist, who used to be a Republican but is now a Democrat. ___ AP writers Tamara Lush in Pinellas County and Mike Schneider in Kissimmee contributed to this report. Share This:",

	      "text": "World News | Wed Jun 29, 2016 5:42pm EDT Mexico president explains comparing Trump to Hitler, Mussolini U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto as they depart a news conference along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (R) at the North American Leaders' Summit in Ottawa, Canada June 29, 2016. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque By Roberta Rampton | OTTAWA \nOTTAWA Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has previously likened U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, said on Wednesday he only drew the comparison as a reminder of the devastation wreaked in the past. \nSpeaking at a press conference alongside U.S. President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau, who have gathered in Ottawa for the \"Three Amigos\" summit, Pena Nieto warned of the dangers of populism in a globalized world. \n\"Hitler, Mussolini, we all know the result,\" he said when asked to explain the comparison. \"It was only a call for reflection and for recognition, so that we bear in mind what we have achieved and the great deal still to achieve.\" \nThe presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, Trump has sparked outrage in Mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to make Mexico pay for it. \nIn March, Pena Nieto likened Trump's \"strident tone\" to the ascent of dictators like Hitler and Mussolini, attacking the \"populism\" of the Trump campaign, which he said sought to put forward simple solutions for complicated problems. \n\"In different places we are presented with political actors and political leaders who assume populist and demagogic positions, and try to eliminate or destroy ... that which has taken decades to build,\" Pena Nieto said on Wednesday. \nTrump has vowed to renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if he becomes president. \nMexico, the United States and Canada signed off on amending NAFTA to liberalize rules of origin for a host of products, the Canadian prime minister's website said on Wednesday. \n\"Isolation is not the path, integration is,\" Pena Nieto said, repeating the fact that Mexico will work with whomever becomes the next U.S. president. \nHe also believed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement was a chance for the three countries to reaffirm ties. \n(Additional reporting by Simon Gardner and David Alire Garcia; Writing by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by James Dalgleish) Trending Stories",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT): 11:10 p.m.\nDonald Trump is railing against the Democratic Party, calling it the party of slavery and Jim Crow.\nThe GOP presidential nominee says his party is the party of freedom, equality and opportunity.\nTrump is continuing his efforts to appeal to minority voters at a Tuesday night rally in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle, where he has drawn a largely white crowd.\nHe claims that Democrats have \"used\" minority voters for \"decades and decades\" and will continue to use them.\nHe says he \"will fight for you like no one ever has before.\"\n__\n9:50 p.m.\nDonald Trump will make a surprise trip to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with the country's president hours before delivering a highly-anticipated speech on immigration.\nTrump says on Twitter that he looks \"very much forward\" to meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto. The Mexican leader had invited both Trump and Hillary Clinton to visit Mexico.\nPena Nieto's office says in its own tweet that the two men will meet in private Wednesday.\nTrump has made illegal immigration and his call for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Pena Nieto has been sharply critical of Trump's insistence that Mexico would pay for a border wall.\n___\n8:25 p.m.\nRepublican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence is back in North Carolina, attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton in a battleground state.\nThe Indiana governor lashed out at Clinton at a campaign rally in Winston-Salem Tuesday over her email controversies, the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi and her dealings with donors to the Clinton Foundation, all while she was secretary of state.\nPence also criticized President Barack Obama, saying the country's influence in the world has weakened under his and Clinton's leadership. Pence also reminded supporters that the composition of the Supreme Court could hinge on the election's outcome.\nPence was in Charlotte last week as both parties are heavily contesting a state that Obama won in 2008 and lost four years later.\n___\n7:25 p.m.\nHillary Clinton is wrapping up a three-day fundraising blitz in the Hamptons.\nThe Democratic presidential nominee hopped from mansion to mansion in the tony New York oceanfront destination, appearing at lunches and dinners where the contributions ranged from $1,000 to $100,000 for guests and hosts. The top-dollar tour was set to conclude Tuesday night with an event in Sag Harbor complete with performances from Jimmy Buffett and Jon Bon Jovi.\nThe events all raised money for the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fund supporting her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state party organizations.\n___\n4:55 p.m.\nThe union that represents stage actors and stage managers has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.\nThe National Council of Actors Equity Association said in a news release Tuesday that this was the first time in the union's 103-year history that it has backed a political candidate. The union voted to endorse the Democratic candidate at a meeting in August, choosing Clinton over Republican nominee Donald Trump.\nEquity President Kate Shindle said in a statement that the union typically remains nonpartisan, but \"at such a critical time in our country's history, this union does not have that luxury if we hope to protect our members. We have to fight with everything we have for our survival.\"\nThe Actors Equity Association represents more than 50,000 professional actors and stage managers.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nHillary Clinton is wrapping up a three-day fundraising blitz in the Hamptons.\nThe Democratic presidential nominee hopped from mansion to mansion in the tony New York oceanfront destination, appearing at lunches and dinners where the contributions ranged from $1,000 to $100,000 for guests and hosts. The top-dollar tour was set to conclude Tuesday night with an event in North Haven complete with performances from Jimmy Buffett and Jon Bon Jovi.\nThe events all raised money for the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fund supporting her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state party organizations.\n___\n4:05 p.m.\nFour leading House Democrats want the FBI to investigate whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign was involved in the recent hack of Democratic Party computers.\nThe lawmakers wrote Tuesday to FBI Director James Comey that his agency should examine whether the Republican candidate's campaign and Russia conducted cyber attacks \"to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\"\nThe letter notes connections between Russia and Trump aides including former campaign manager Paul Manafort. He resigned following revelations of past work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Some experts believe Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee that led tothe release of thousands of Democratic documents.\nWriting Comey were Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Elliot Engel of New York and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.\n___\n3:15 p.m.\nA conservative legal group has submitted 25 written questions to Hillary Clinton about her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.\nJudicial Watch submitted the questions to the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday following an order issued this month by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan.\nJudicial Watch has filed several lawsuits seeking government records related to Clinton. Sullivan's order was only a partial victory for the group, which had sought to depose Clinton in person.\nIt was not immediately clear from the wording of Sullivan's order whether Clinton must answer the questions under oath before or after the November election. Judicial Watch contends the deadline is Sept. 29. Clinton lawyer David Kendall did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n___\n2:35 p.m.\nThe White House says President Barack Obama's national security advisers are discussing whether to designate state election systems as \"critical infrastructure.\"\nSpokesman Josh Earnest says such a designation would make federal resources available to help states secure those systems.\nHe offered no timetable on when a decision would be made.\nThe FBI has warned state officials to boost election security in light of evidence that hackers had targeted related data systems in two states the agency has not identified.\nFederal officials are concerned that hackers, particularly those working for Russia or another country, could breach U.S. elections systems and wreak havoc on the November elections.\nEarnest says the decentralized nature of the U.S. election system makes it harder to manipulate the outcome.\n___\n2:10 p.m.\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is describing Donald Trump's campaign as a con job, saying the Republican nominee has \"utterly failed\" to answer basic questions about his finances and background.\nSpeaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Kaine ticked through a list of areas in which he says Trump is being too secretive. Those areas include his finances, foreign ties, taxes and even his health.\nKaine questioned his business ties to Russia, suggesting Trump would not prevent Russia from invading American allies. Trump has been critical of the NATO alliance.\nAnd Kaine is pushing back against Trump's allegations that Hillary Clinton is in poor health. He told the crowd he can barely keep up with the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail, adding \"Hillary Clinton is one tough and one healthy person.\"\n___\n12:35 p.m.\nThe State Department says about 30 emails involving the 2012 attack on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya, are among the thousands of Hillary Clinton emails recovered during the FBI's recently closed investigation into the former secretary's use of a private server.\nGovernment lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton to State. The agency said it would need until the end of September to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released.\nThe hearing was held in one of several lawsuits filed by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch, which is seeking government records involving the Democratic presidential nominee.\n___\n11:50 a.m.\nA trio of House Democrats is calling on congressional Republicans to denounce what they called \"hateful rhetoric\" by Donald Trump.\nPointing to the role that strong language can play in politics, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn said Tuesday during a press call organized by the Hillary Clinton campaign that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should \"stand up and disavow the kind of hateful rhetoric that we're hearing from Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.\"\nClyburn also said a tweet by a black Trump supporter showing Clinton in black face \"went beyond the pale.\"\nClyburn was referencing Pastor Mark Burns' posting earlier this week implying Clinton is pandering to black voters. The South Carolina pastor has since apologized for the tweet and said he should have used \"better judgment.\"\nIf Trump is serious about courting black voters, Clyburn said, he shouldn't turn down invitations to speak to groups like the NAACP.\n\"You don't go to a 99 percent white audience and talk about us and call that an invitation to us,\" the South Carolina Democrat said.\n___\n11:45 a.m.\nThe FBI is expected to release documents soon related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton and her use of a private email server.\nA law enforcement official said Tuesday that documents in the case would be made public as the FBI responds to Freedom of Information Act requests.\nIt wasn't immediately clear when the documents would be released or exactly what they would include. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe FBI this month provided Congress portions of its file from the agency's yearlong investigation into whether then-Secretary of State Clinton and her top aides mishandled classified information that flowed through a private email server.\nCNN reported that the records could be made public as early as Wednesday.\n—By Eric Tucker in Washington\n___\n3:15 a.m.\nDonald Trump and his aides used to say that voters didn't care about the nitty-gritty of policy details. But now those details are tripping up his campaign.\nTrump has appeared to wrestle with his controversial pledge to expel everyone living in the U.S. illegally with the help of a \"deportation force.\"\nThe GOP nominee polled an audience last week on the fate of an estimated 11 million people. It was a stunning display of indecision from a candidate who has asked voters to put enormous faith in his gut instincts.\nTrump is now planning a major speech on immigration Wednesday. Supporters are hoping for a strong, decisive showing. But the episode underscores how little time his campaign has invested in outlining how he would accomplish his goals as president.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show Clinton's Tuesday night fundraising event is in Sag Harbor, instead of North Haven.",

REUTERS/Erik De Castro \nMANILA Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday he was ready to discuss any issues with Barack Obama when they meet in Laos next week, but added that the U.S. president must listen to him first before bringing up the question of human rights. \nWashington has expressed concern about a surge in drug-related killings since Duterte became president two months ago promising to wipe out narcotics in the Southeast Asian nation. \nAsked if he would be willing to discuss human rights at his meeting with Obama on the sidelines of an East Asia summit on Sept. 6, Duterte told reporters: \"Depends to what degree\". \n\"They must understand the problem first before we talk about human rights. I would insist, listen to me: this is what the problem is, then we can talk.\" \n(Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore) Trending Stories ",

	      "text": "By Steve Holland WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he plans to meet Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday, hours before outlining his proposals for cracking down on illegal immigration.\nThe hastily arranged trip will be Trump's second significant appearance on the world stage during his presidential campaign. A June visit to his golf courses in Scotland was dominated by his reaction to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.\nThe Mexico trip looked to be the type of dramatic, Trump-style event to ensure he dominates the headlines as he tries to further close a gap in national opinion polls that now favors his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\"I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow,\" Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday.\nThe Mexican government also confirmed the meeting in a tweet on Tuesday, saying Trump had accepted an invitation to meet Pena Nieto in private.\nPena Nieto later tweeted about the meeting, then added:\n\"I believe in dialogue to promote Mexico's interests in the world, and chiefly, to protect Mexicans wherever they are.\"\nTrump has said, if elected on Nov. 8, he would carry out a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico to prevent illegal crossings into the United States.\nHe has steadfastly demanded that Mexico pay for the wall, a position that Trump supporters cheer but which Mexican officials have scoffed at.\nTalks between the Trump campaign and the Mexican government on the trip began after Trump decided last weekend to take Pena Nieto up on an offer to meet, a source familiar with the situation said.\nTrump is expected to meet the Mexican leader in Mexico in between fundraising events he has scheduled in California and his immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday night.\nPena Nieto has publicly voiced skepticism about Trump.\nAt a June 29 news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa, Pena Nieto warned of the dangers of populism in a globalized world and defended comments earlier this year in which he likened Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.\n\"Hitler, Mussolini, we all know the result,\" he said when asked to explain the comparison. \"It was only a call for reflection and for recognition, so that we bear in mind what we have achieved and the great deal still to achieve.\"\nIn his speech in Arizona, Trump will detail where he stands on illegal immigration after worrying some conservative allies when he said last week he was \"softening\" his stance on mass deportations.\nTrump aides said he would reaffirm his determination to build the border wall to curtail new illegal crossings and quickly deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in the United States.\nHowever, the central question facing Trump was how he would treat the majority of the 11 million illegal immigrants who have set down roots in their communities and obeyed U.S. laws, an issue that has bedeviled the immigration debate for years.\n(Additional reporting by Dave Graham in Mexico City; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Paul Tait and Clarence Fernandez)",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When Bill Clinton told the staff of his global charity he would have to step down if Hillary Clinton won the White House, he was vividly clear about how that felt: Worse than a root canal, he said. For Clinton, the foundation that bears his name has shaped much of his post-White House legacy, helping transform him from a popular yet scandal-tainted former president into an international philanthropist and humanitarian. But the Clinton Foundation is also the focus of election-year scrutiny — pushed along by Donald Trump — about the Democratic power couple’s ability and willingness to separate the organization’s wealthy contributors from past and possible future government roles.\nThe decisions surrounding the foundation’s future are the latest chapter in an unprecedented partnership of personal and political ambitions. While political spouses — Hillary Clinton among them — often put aside their own goals, never before has that been required of a former president.\nFriends and associates say that while Bill Clinton knows his role in the high-profile charity has to change, settling on how and when he might walk away has been emotional. He’s also said to be deeply frustrated with the criticism shadowing his potential exit.\nRelated:\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View.\n“We’re trying to do good things. If there’s something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives, I don’t know what it is,” he said last week.\nMark Updegrove, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library and author of “Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House,” said that while the foundation has unquestionably done good work around the world, the former president has no choice but to step aside if his wife wins the White House.\n“Bill Clinton is smart enough to know that as much as the Clinton Foundation might help to augment his legacy, Hillary Clinton becoming president will be a far greater legacy than anything he himself can do as a former president,” Updegrove said.\nThe foundation made some adjustments after she became secretary of state, but it has still faced numerous questions about how rigorously firewalls were upheld that were meant to separate donors from her government work.\nAn Associated Press review of Clinton’s calendars from a two-year stretch show that more than half of those she met with from outside of government had made contributions to the foundation.\nFor Trump and other Republicans, the Clintons’ overlapping worlds are rife with ethical lapses. And for some Democrats, even that perception is worrisome in an election year where control of the White House and Congress are at stake.\nMeanwhile, there’s an odd reality of modern American politics: What presidents do after leaving the White House can shape their legacy almost as much as their tenure in the Oval Office.\nIt can be an opportunity to bolster presidential successes and try to make up for failures. And those who leave office relatively young — Clinton was 54 — can spend many more years on these legacy projects than they did in the White House.\n“For the last 15 years, it has been his life,” said Tina Flournoy, Clinton’s chief of staff. During the announcement of his potential departure, she said he noted that his role as head of the foundation was “the longest job he has held.”\nJimmy Carter, who was seen by some as an ineffectual one-term president, has dramatically reshaped his image with decades of work on global issues. George W. Bush left office deeply unpopular, but has been applauded for dedicating his post-White House years to HIV programs in Africa and work with wounded military veterans. President Barack Obama has been discussing plans for his White House afterlife with confidants for months.\n“There’s a certain expectation that you stay involved, you don’t totally get off the scene,” said Anita McBride, a longtime Bush family aide.\nBill Clinton’s foundation began largely to support the building of his presidential library in Little Rock, Arkansas. As his post-White House ambitions grew, so did the foundation, ballooning into a $2 billion charity focused on global health, climate change and other international efforts.\nThe former president has leveraged his contacts to fill the foundation’s coffers and traveled the world to meet with people helped by its work. He’s the star of the annual Clinton Global Initiative meetings in New York, a mingling of international power players and celebrities that has become the hottest invitation in the philanthropic community.\nThe plan for the foundation’s future in the event of a Clinton victory this fall includes daughter Chelsea Clinton remaining. Foreign and corporate donations will be halted, though the foundation is looking for ways to spin off some programs and keep them running.\nThe prospect of Bill Clinton stepping away from the foundation that has been the main outlet for his energy and intellect has renewed discussions about how he would fill his time in his wife’s administration. Though he’s now 70 and slowed by health issues, people close to the Clintons say they fully expect him to seek a prominent role. Hillary Clinton has even raised the prospect of putting her husband in charge of “revitalizing the economy.”\n“He just has to feel productive every single day,” said Susie Tompkins Buell, a longtime Clinton friend. “If he gets into another situation where he’s going to have that ability, he’s going to be fine.”\n___\nFollow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",

	      "text": "By Steve Holland WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he will meet Mexico's president on Wednesday, hours before he sets out proposals to crack down on illegal immigration that have stirred up widespread anger among Mexicans.\nThe hastily arranged trip will be Trump's second significant appearance on the world stage during his presidential campaign. A June visit to his golf courses in Scotland was dominated by his reaction to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.\nThe meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto looked to be the type of dramatic, Trump-style event to ensure he dominates the headlines as he tries to close a gap in national opinion polls that now favors his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\"I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow,\" Trump said on social network Twitter on Tuesday.\nThe Mexican government, which has bristled at Trump's threats to wall off Mexico and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement, also confirmed the meeting in a tweet, saying Trump had agreed to meet Pena Nieto in private.\nPena Nieto later tweeted about the meeting, then added:\n\"I believe in dialogue to promote Mexico's interests in the world, and chiefly, to protect Mexicans wherever they are.\"\nTrump has been pilloried by media in Mexico since he launched his presidential campaign last year with a barrage of broadsides against the country, saying it sent rapists and drug dealers north across the border.\nThe meeting appeared to be a gamble by Pena Nieto, whose popularity has slumped to all-time lows, and opposition politicians reacted with dismay.\n\"Be part of the campaign of a candidate dedicated to insulting us? Why?\" said former interior minister Alejandro Poire, retweeting #TrumpNotWelcome hashtags on Twitter.\nBORDER WALL\nTrump has said, if elected on Nov. 8, he would carry out his pledge to build a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico to prevent illegal crossings into the United States.\nHe has steadfastly demanded that Mexico pay for the wall, a position Trump supporters cheer but which Mexican officials scoff at.\nTalks between the Trump campaign and the Mexican government on the trip began after Trump decided last weekend to take up Pena Nieto on an offer to meet, a source familiar with the situation said.\nTrump is expected to meet the Mexican leader in Mexico in between fundraising events he has scheduled in California and his immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday night.\nPena Nieto has publicly voiced skepticism about Trump.\nAt a June 29 news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa, Pena Nieto warned of the dangers of populism in a globalized world and defended comments likening Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.\n\"Hitler, Mussolini, we all know the result,\" he said, when asked to explain the comparison. \"It was only a call for reflection and for recognition, so that we bear in mind what we have achieved and the great deal still to achieve.\"\nIn his Arizona speech, Trump will detail where he stands on illegal immigration after worrying some conservative allies when he said last week he was \"softening\" his position on mass deportations.\nTrump aides said he would reaffirm his determination to build the border wall to cut new illegal crossings and quickly deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in the United States.\nHowever, the central question facing Trump was how he would treat the majority of the 11 million illegal immigrants who have set down roots in their communities and obeyed U.S. laws, an issue that bedevils the immigration debate.\n(Additional reporting by Dave Graham in Mexico City; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Paul Tait and Clarence Fernandez)",

	      "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy each easily won their Senate primaries Tuesday, setting up a November showdown that's guaranteed to be nasty as each party grapples for a majority in the chamber. Rubio, who decided at the last second to seek a second term, easily fended off millionaire homebuilder Carlos Beruff and Murphy used the backing of President Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders to defeat U.S. Rep Alan Grayson, who was counting on his party's most faithful liberal voters to overcome Murphy's money and establishment support.\nIn other races, U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown lost a primary as she faces felony fraud charges. She was one of the first African-Americans elected to Congress from Florida since Reconstruction. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who recently resigned as Democratic National Committee chair, won her primary — the first tough race since being elected to Congress in 2004.\nRubio's and Murphy's victory speeches set the tone for the Senate race.\n\"Marco Rubio is the worst of Washington because he puts himself first every time. He gave up on his job. He gave up on Florida. He earned the worst voting record for any Florida senator in 50 years,\" Murphy said shortly after polls closed.\nRubio spoke about an hour later and said Murphy has lied about his education and his career and is only successful because of his wealthy father.\n\"How can someone with that kind of record think he can be elected to the U.S. Senate? The answer is he has a sense of entitlement, because when everything you've ever had in your life is given to you, you think you deserve it all,\" Rubio said.\nRubio had declared during his failed presidential campaign that he would not run again for Senate. But he nearly cleared what had been a crowded GOP field with his last-minute turnabout.\nBeruff rolled the dice to see if the anti-establishment mood powering Donald Trump's presidential campaign could send him to Washington as well. But after spending $8 million of his own money and going nowhere in the polls, he essentially shut down his campaign ahead of the primary.\n\"I voted for Marco only because I've been a longstanding supporter,\" said Diane Martin-Johnson, 66, after voting early Tuesday in Pinellas Park. \"It's unfortunate he didn't do his job fully in Washington this term. I do think he deserves another chance. He thought he was doing the right thing (by running for president). That's my only complaint against him. He's a good man.\"\nMurphy, a former Republican, quickly earned party support and raised significantly more money. He was also backed by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. Grayson, a fiery liberal known for brash comments and hamstrung by a difficult divorce, relied mostly on small donors and feuded with party leaders.\nTodd Martin, 53, and his 18-year-old daughter Haley, voted together in Tallahassee, where they recently moved as she starts college. They both chose Murphy, in part because they like his efforts to get government to address algae outbreaks near their former home in Vero Beach.\n\"I grew up on the river and it's a shame what they let happen,\" Todd Martin said. \"I like where Patrick Murphy stands on the algae. It's very important to me.\"\nMore than 1.75 million Floridians already cast ballots by mail or at early-voting stations before polls opened Tuesday.\nThis year's primary turnout could top ones held in 2012 and 2014— a sign that competitive races for Congress and the Florida Legislature could be driving up turnout this time around.\nWasserman Schultz easily beat Tim Canova, a Bernie Sanders-backed law professor who was able to raise more than $3 million in a primary colored by leaked emails revealing that DNC officials had worked against Sanders to favor Hillary Clinton in the presidential race.\nBrown lost to longtime state lawmaker Al Lawson, who has previously run for Congress.\nDemocrats hope to gain seats in Florida's heavily Republican House delegation after court-mandated redistricting chipped away the advantages of some incumbents.\nFlorida had to rip up and redraw its congressional maps after they were found to violate the state constitution's provision requiring compact districts that don't favor incumbents or political parties. That spurred one of the state's most heavily contested congressional election years. Several races will essentially be decided in the primary and Florida will eventually send at least seven new House members to Washington.\nRepublicans now outnumber Democrats 17-10 in the state's congressional delegation. If Democrats sweep all four seats seen as competitive in November, that Republican advantage could be reduced to 14-13.\nOne of those is now held by U.S. Rep. David Jolly, a Republican who was expected to win Tuesday, but who would then have to beat former Gov. Charlie Crist, who used to be a Republican but is now a Democrat.\n___\nAP writers Tamara Lush in Pinellas County, Mike Schneider in Kissimmee and Terry Spencer in Palm Beach Gardens contributed to this report.",

	      "text": "By Marc Frank and Jeffrey Dastin HAVANA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - An expected explosion in U.S. tourism to Cuba will likely take years to materialize even after U.S. airlines resume commercial flights to the Caribbean island this week for the first time since 1961, industry officials said.\nJetBlue Airways Corp will pilot its historic flight from Florida to the Cuban city of Santa Clara on Wednesday, the latest step in normalizing relations that earlier this year included a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama and the first U.S. cruise to the island in decades.\nThe planes may some day be filled with U.S. beach-goers, looking for an economical Caribbean break at resorts favored by Canadians and Europeans on the sandy keys north of Santa Clara.\nBut for now, U.S. law and constraints on Cuba's tourism infrastructure will act as brakes on increasing demand, experts said.\nCongress has yet to lift a trade embargo that prohibits U.S. citizens from visiting Cuba as tourists. The Obama administration has approved 12 categories of exceptions to the ban ranging from cultural, religious and educational travel to business and visiting family.\nThat means JetBlue's initial flights will mainly carry Cuban-Americans visiting relatives or other U.S. citizens interested in seeing the Che Guevara Mausoleum and other cultural sites.\nEventually, up to 25 flights a day by various carriers will connect the United States and the Cuban provinces, with another 20 to Havana, under an agreement reached by the two Cold War foes as part of a gradual détente begun in December 2014.\nServices on Silver Airways and American Airlines Group Inc from the Miami area to other outlying provinces are the next to start, in September.\nWhile the direct flights could carry more than a million U.S. residents to Cuba annually, according to John Kavulich, head of the New York-based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc, he and other experts believe that mark will not be reached for several years.\nIn the beginning, the new routes are expected to absorb customers from the average of 17 charter flights that Cuba's government says have arrived from the United States daily for several years.\n\"The fares that have come out so far, announced by American and JetBlue, have been super competitive,\" said Bob Guild, vice president at Marazul Charters Inc. \"I don't have any question that it's going to shrink,\" he said of the charter services. Marazul, one of the largest charter companies operating to Cuba, plans to scale back services to provinces this fall but continue with its Havana flights while commercial airlines await approval, Guild said.\nHOTEL ROOMS FULL\nThere is already a boom in visits to Cuba from the United States. Some 300,000 Cubans living in the United States now travel home annually. In 2015, the Cuban government reported 161,233 Americans visited, compared to 91,254 in 2014, and arrivals through June nearly doubled over the same period last year, a trend that the dawn of commercial flights can only further.\n\"The fact that travelers can book flights directly online not only streamlines that process and makes it more affordable, it adds a feeling of legality,\" said Collin Laverty of Cuban Educational Travel.\nBut another barrier to increased U.S. travel is that Cuba's hotels, bed and breakfasts, transportation services and amenities are already stretched to the limit, with a record 3.5 million foreign arrivals last year. Higher hotel prices, pegged to the U.S. dollar, might push out some travelers from Europe and Canada, creating more space for Americans, said Emilio Morales, CEO of Miami-based Havana Consulting Group. Private bed and breakfasts would absorb what they could of increased demand, he said.\nOver time, airlines are betting travel restrictions will be further relaxed and want to get their foot in the door before Obama leaves office next year.\n\"While all of the flights are unlikely to operate at capacity, the airlines want to plant their respective flags,\" Kavulich said.\n(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

	      "text": "Por CNN 03:12 ET (07:12 GMT) 31 agosto, 2016 \n(CNN Money) - ¿Qué otra cosa puede ser posible añadir a tu currículum después de servir como presidente de Estados Unidos? Editor de revista, al parecer. \nEl presidente Obama será invitado a editar el número de noviembre de Wired, lo que la revista está promocionando como la primera vez que una revista será editada por un presidente en ejercicio. \nLa edición, programada para salir en octubre, se enfocará en \"los obstáculos que la humanidad debe superar para seguir adelante\", de acuerdo con un anuncio hecho por Wired este martes. I’m honored to announce that @POTUS is guest-editing November's issue of @WIRED https://t.co/gU41urXfxl #WIREDxPOTUS pic.twitter.com/85P3odjafw \n— Scott Dadich (@sdadich) August 30, 2016 \n\"Estos incluirán las fronteras personales, desde la medicina hasta el actuar humano; fronteras locales, incluyendo el uso de datos en la planificación urbana y haciendo trabajos de energía renovable que funcionen para todos; fronteras nacionales, desde los derechos civiles hasta datos médicos\", indicó Robert Capps, jefe de redacción editorial de Wired, en el anuncio. \nTambién incluirá \"fronteras internacionales, como el cambio climático y la seguridad cibernética; y fronteras finales, en la que se incluirán temas como los viajes espaciales e inteligencia artifical\", de acuerdo con Capps. \nEl anuncio se dio pocos días después de que Wired apoyó a Hillary Clinton, marcando el primer respaldo presidencial de la revista en sus 23 años de historia. \nClinton ganó el apoyo de Wired por apoyar la neutralidad en la red, por su compromiso por fortalecer Ley de Protección al Paciente y Cuidado de Salud Asequible y por luchar por hacer más fácil la inmigración. \nEl gobierno de Obama ha sido particularmente acogedor con la industria de la tecnología, la cual es cubierta por Wired. \nDecenas de emplados de Obama no han dejado su puesto de trabajo por compañías como Google, Facebook, Amazon y Uber, y ejecutivos de algunas de estas empresas también han asumido roles tecnológicos en la administración de Obama. \nObama, como Clinton, ha presionado por temas que son apoyados por Wired y la comunidad tecnológica, incluido el emprendedurismo y la necesidad de una reforma inmigratoria para los trabajadores calificados. \nObama ha llegado a sugerir que podría estar interesado en hacer algún trabajo como un capitalista de riesgo después de dejar la Casa Blanca.

	      "text": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Wednesday he was ready to defend his bloody crackdown on illegal drugs, which has sparked U.S. and international concerns, with President Barack Obama on the sidelines of an Asian summit next week. Duterte said he would demand that he be allowed to first explain the context of his crackdown before engaging Obama in a discussion of the widespread deaths. The two will meet for the first time on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Western leaders in Laos.\nNearly 1,800 suspected drug dealers and users have been killed since July 1, and U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in Washington Monday that Obama plans to raise U.S. concerns over the killings with Duterte.\n\"They must understand the problem first before we talk about human rights,\" Duterte told a news conference. \"I would insist, 'Listen to me. This is what the problem is.' Then we can talk. No problem.\"\nSpeaking at Manila's international airport, Duterte warned more than 120 Filipino workers who returned after they were laid off in Saudi Arabia to stay away from illegal drugs.\n\"Avoid drugs at all costs because it could cost your life too,\" Duterte said, adding that more than 3 million Filipinos are drug addicts.\nCriticism by the U.S. government, U.N. rights experts and human rights groups over the drugs killings have provoked angry outbursts from Duterte, who, at one point, threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the U.N.\nDuterte said that the world body and the U.S. have failed to prevent genocidal killings in Africa and the Middle East but criticize his crackdown, which targets hardcore criminals who destroy Philippine society.\nThe U.S. has expressed concern over the extrajudicial killings and urged Duterte's government to ensure law enforcement efforts comply with human rights obligations.\n\"We are concerned by these detentions, as well as the extrajudicial killings of individuals suspected to be involved in drug activity in the Philippines,\" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said. \"We strongly urge the Philippines to ensure its law enforcement efforts comply with its human rights obligations.\"\nShe added: \"We believe in rule of law. We believe in due process. We believe in respect for universal human rights. We believe, fundamentally, that those aspects ensure and promote long-term security.\"\nDuterte has had an uneasy relationship with America and has said he will chart a foreign policy that is not dependent on the U.S., his country's longtime treaty ally. Duterte has also tried to repair relations with China that have been strained over escalating territorial disputes in the South China Sea.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Will Hillary Clinton's GOP outreach alienate progressives? By Tal Kopan , CNN Updated 1010 GMT (1810 HKT) August 31, 2016 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Story highlights One of Clinton's persistent criticisms from the left has been that her foreign policy is too conservative A raft of Republicans and neoconservatives have lined up to endorse Clinton Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is looking to take advantage of Donald Trump's lagging support among Republicans, courting them to her fold in the presidential race. But there's one group watching her GOP outreach with wary eyes: her progressive supporters. One of Clinton's persistent criticisms from the left has been that her foreign policy is too conservative. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hit Clinton throughout the primary for her vote in favor of the Iraq War and past support of free trade deals. And the liberal blogosphere has long labeled Clinton part of the neoconservative wing, a conservative intellectual movement that supports an interventionist foreign policy. Clinton has welcomed Republicans' support without making policy outreach. Her campaign has reached out to big Republican names for endorsements and one of them, Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, is even hitting the campaign trail for Clinton. Also in Clinton's camp are Brookings Institution scholar and former Republican adviser Robert Kagan, foreign policy presidential adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Bush administration official Richard Armitage and former Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Read More Even Paul Wolfowitz, the former George W. Bush administration official credited as one of the architects behind the Iraq War and an anchor of the neocon movement, said he may vote for Clinton. Wolfowitz 'might have to vote' for Clinton Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who has the most to gain from a liberal defection away from Clinton, pointed to the Democratic candidate's GOP support in an interview with The Washington Post this month as a sign of Democrats resembling the GOP. \"You can also look at Hillary's new organization for reaching out to Republicans. The massive influx of Republicans into her campaign... it reflects what her agenda is,\" Stein said. Later she tweeted : \"Iraq War mastermind Paul Wolfowitz plans to vote Clinton: latest example of the Dems becoming neocon war hawks' preferred party. #NoMoreWar.\" Iraq War mastermind Paul Wolfowitz plans to vote Clinton: latest example of the Dems becoming neocon war hawks' preferred party. #NoMoreWar — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) August 26, 2016 For now, Clinton's hold on self-identified Democrats remains strong, while Trump has a higher than normal defection rate of Republicans. Progressives that lined up behind her campaign after Sanders was eliminated from contention aren't scared off -- yet. Still, those liberals will be closely watching the presidential debates to see how far Clinton's recruitment of Republicans goes, said Symone Sanders, Bernie Sanders' former press secretary. \"As long as Secretary Clinton doesn't move on the issues or promises she has made to her supporters, that she has made to the progressive movement, as long as she upholds the most progressive platform in party history... she's in safe territory,\" Symone Sanders said. \"But the moment these progressives feel these endorsements influence where she stands on the issues, that becomes a problem and that's where she loses that support.\" Asked about her name-dropping prominent GOP politicians in a recent speech attacking Trump's rhetoric on race and whether that was an overture to Republican voters, Clinton said she is \"absolutely ... reaching out to everyone.\" \"This is not a normal choice between a Republican and a Democrat ... we are facing a divisive candidate who's loose-cannon temperament and his complete lack of preparation make him unqualified to be president,\" she told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" last week. \"I am reaching out and asking fair-minded Americans to repudiate this kind of divisive demagoguery.\" Pollsters say there doesn't appear to be a movement of \"Clinton Republicans\" the way \"Reagan Democrats\" reshaped American politics. \"Obviously, these defections are creating a real problem electorally for Mr. Trump,\" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. \"Compared to four years ago, twice as many Republicans say they're going to vote for the Democratic candidate than did so four years ago. ... But to try to make this into a movement that has multi-election legs, we don't know.\" Brown noted that what has been historic about this election is the unprecedented high unfavorability ratings of both candidates. Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray echoed Brown, saying that a majority of voters are voting against a candidate rather than for someone. \"These are not Hillary Republicans, these are anti-Trump Republicans,\" Murray said. \"And I don't see anything Hillary Clinton's doing that is specifically designed to appeal to Republicans in terms of a vision that is designed to appeal to a specific segment, which is what Reagan did.\" Both pollsters also said their data shows few warning signs for Clinton with progressives at this point. Murray said many of Sanders' die-hard supporters were never reliable Democratic voters, and thus haven't impacted Clinton's base as they've gone back to their independent tendencies. But if the race tightens, she could use that support. Former adviser to President Barack Obama and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, called the phenomenon more \"Trump Democrats\" than \"Hillary Republicans,\" and said that as long as Clinton's opponent is Trump, she has some leeway with progressives. \"The severity of the threat that many Democrats and some Republicans think that Trump represents gives her a lot of running room,\" said Axelrod, a CNN commentator. That's the viewpoint of some of the Republicans endorsing Clinton, as well. Former Bush official Ricardo Reyes co-founded the group R4C (Republicans for Clinton) to make the case that Republicans should vote for Clinton over Trump, but vote for the GOP down the rest of the ticket. He said he and his supporters had hoped for an alternative to Trump within the party or from a third-party candidacy, but that didn't emerge. \"When (RNC Chairman) Reince Priebus and (House Speaker) Paul Ryan said it was a \"binary choice between Trump and Clinton, and that made it very, very stark for us,\" Reyes said, adding Clinton has a history of bipartisan work in the Senate. \"Do I agree with Hillary Clinton and all her policies? Of course not. I don't think Democrats do either. But if you step back and you think one candidate is going to careen this country into oblivion, and you have another candidate who has a history of working with others, then it's clear.\" Sections",

	      "text": "Free speech or criminal threats? 03:07 Story highlights The federal government wants Peter Ronald Wexler behind bars for what he's written His lawyers say the Constitution should protect him Los Angeles (CNN) Hunched over the keyboard of his computer in a mobile home park a few miles from Disneyland, Peter Ronald Wexler allegedly blogged in support of cop killers and the terror group ISIS, according to authorities. He even \"encouraged others to 'level' the Turkish Consulate in LA with a Ryder truck,\" they said. Following an anonymous tip about his provocative online posts, an FBI supervisor in Los Angeles weighed in on the material. \"Everything we have reviewed to date falls into the category of First Amendment protected speech,\" Special Agent Voviette D. Morgan wrote in an email dated September 7, 2015. That would all change a day later when agents showed up at Wexler's RV to conduct a threat assessment. Read More Wexler, 50, politely turned agents away at the door. Then he turned to his keyboard: \"Is it murder to kill an FBI Pig who knocks on your door without a warrant?\" Wexler allegedly wrote in a blog post. \"I think not.\" A day later he posted \"a personal MEMO to David Bowdich,\" the FBI's top agent in Southern California. \"If your [expletive] goons ever show up at my house again,\" the post read, \"my knife will strike the necks.\" Wexler has since been charged in a 20-count federal indictment with making criminal threats to harm or kill Bowdich and other agents, including by \"cutting their throats and beheading them.\" He has pleaded not guilty. His trial, which quietly got underway last week in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, promises to test the limits of what constitutes free speech. The case is expected to go to the jury Wednesday morning. Following Wexler's arrest, Bowdich went on to become the public face of the FBI in the wake of the San Bernardino terrorist attacks. He has since been promoted to a top job at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. Bowdich testified last week that he was told about Wexler's blog posts when he headed up the Los Angeles field office and that he took them seriously. He said he was concerned about his family's safety. In order to win a conviction against Wexler, prosecutors must convince jurors that Wexler's comments were \"a serious expression of an intent to physically harm or murder\" Bowdich and other agents and that \"a reasonable person\" would interpret them that way as well. Wexler's defense attorneys contend that their client is a non-violent satirical blogger whose postings are \"core political speech\" protected under the First Amendment. The posts about Bowdich and the FBI are taken from among hundreds of entries dealing with topics such as US foreign policy in the Middle East, presidential politics and policing in America and contained strong languages and images throughout. \"If you look at the whole blog, it's obvious this is political satire,\" defense attorney Caleb Mason said in a recent interview with CNN. \"The government has made not one single allegation that Mr. Wexler has ever done a violent thing in his life,\" co-counsel Marri Derby wrote in court filing. Mason is a former federal prosecutor who in 2009 won a conviction against a man charged with making threats against then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, only to have the conviction overturned on the basis that his supposedly threatening words were in fact protected free speech. \"This case is no different,\" he said. Mason, now in private practice, said he joined Wexler's defense on a pro-bono basis as a matter of principle. Defending Wexler, Mason said in an interview, \"is like the ACLU defending the Nazis in Skokie.\" Prosecutors have portrayed Wexler as a serious threat not only to Bowdich, but to those investigating him as well. They sought and received special permission to conduct a pre-dawn SWAT raid to arrest him, despite a peaceful encounter weeks earlier, and persuaded a federal judge he posed a continuing danger to the public and should be held without bail prior to trial. The case is being handled by anti-terrorism prosecutors and is being closely watched by supervisors in the Los Angeles US Attorney's office. Mason and Derby paint a picture of a socially awkward, unemployed systems administrator who takes out his frustration on the keyboard. The defense attorneys hinted at psychiatric problems earlier in the case but ultimately did not proceed with a \"diminished capacity\" defense. Wexler created his blog in 2006 and seems to have blogged in relative obscurity for years. He testified that he relied on sarcasm and hyperbole to get his points across and intended to be provocative. But he said none of his posts were intended to convey threats to Bowdich or other agents. He came to the attention of the FBI following a series of allegedly threatening emails and posts in the summer and fall of 2015. In July, he wrote that various officials and institutions in Texas ought to be \"lit up\" in retribution for the death of Sandra Bland, an African-American woman who hanged herself following a minor traffic stop and subsequent arrest. A month later, he posted a message on the Jacksonville, Florida airport's Facebook page saying the Jacksonville Aviation Authority \"needs to be blown out of existence.\" The message included the Arabic phrase, \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is great.\" Later that month, he emailed staff members at Leavenworth federal prison in Kansas complaining about the treatment of Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning, an American soldier convicted of espionage. He wrote that Manning's treatment \"requires revenge\" and directed \"ISIS Throat Slitters\" to a beach near Camp Pendleton frequented by Marines and their families. \"It is the perfect place to go and slit many throats,\" Wexler wrote. On September 6, the FBI received the anonymous tip that prompted agent's Morgan's review of his blog and the visit to his home. All of the counts charged in the indictment stem from a tirade of posts made in the wake of that visit. He told agents on his blog not to bother him again \"unless you're looking for a Left-Handed Shave with my kitchen knife, a Schrade SCHF9, whch can chop down a tree and perfectly slice a juicy red, vine-ripened tomato, in that order!\" [The left-handed reference apparently applies to \"Jihadi John,\" an ISIS executioner who appears in several Internet beheading videos.] Wexler singled out Bowdich who, he wrote, should be \"shot in the back!\" \"That [expletive] just got under my skin, and my trigger finger is suddenly getting very itchy.\" The postings included a photo of Bowdich's head placed in the crosshairs of a rifle scope and superimposed onto the bodies of ISIS beheading victims. Two and a half weeks after their initial visit to Wexler's RV, agents armed with a search warrant descended on the location before dawn. Members of the bureau's SWAT team deployed a \"flash bang grenade\" as diversion and attempted to pry open the RV's windshield. A sleeping Wexler was arrested without incident. During the September 25 raid, they discovered the same knife mentioned in his post and found Google searches to determine the precise location where Bowdich worked, prosecutors allege. They've introduced the knife, found along with other cooking implements in a drawer near the RV's kitchen, as evidence at trial in an attempt to show that Wexler had the means to carry out the attack. But an email from one FBI case agent to another turned over to defense attorneys suggests that agent was not taking the threat as seriously as prosecutors. The message from agent Mark R. Espiritu was an apparent reference to Wexler's post about his kinfe's ability to slice through vine-ripened tomatoes. \"Hey bro,\" the September 8 email read, \"it'd be funny if we showed up with tomatoes for our next visit. Or even just left one on his door step.\" Prosecutors dismissed the exchange as a joke intended to diffuse tension in a stressful situation. Obtaining a conviction in what's known as a \"pure speech\" case can be difficult. Mason, the former prosecutor now representing Wexler, thought he had done so in the case of the United States v. Bagdasarian. Walter Bagdasarian referred to then-Sen. Obama with racial slurs in online posts during the 2008 presidential campaign and wrote that \"he will have a .50 cal in the head soon.\" Secret Service agents searched Bagdasarian's house and found guns, including a .50 caliber rifle. He was convicted of criminal threats against Obama and sentenced to time served. Two years later, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his conviction. The court ruled that Bagdasarian's statement was not a \"true threat\" to Obama and that his speech -- however unpleasant -- was protected by the first amendment. Mason, who was part of team of prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego, said he believed Bagdasarian was guilty at the time. But he said the court's reversal created new case law that would bar him from prosecuting the case today. Mason did not seek to defend Wexler's views, only his constitutional right to express them. \"Is all of this nasty, offensive? Yes, for sure,\" he told jurors during closing arguments. \"But it is not a crime.\" Assistant US Attorney Melissa Mills told the jury the limits of Wexler's free speech ended with Bowdich's and the other agents' rights to feel safe. \"Threats are not protected by the Constitution,\" she said.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo By Roberta Rampton | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Wednesday embarked on a 10-day trip during which he will stress the urgency of curbing climate change and try to achieve some final agreements on the issue with world leaders at a G20 meeting in China. \nObama, who is racing to cement his legacy on climate before his presidency ends on Jan. 20, will showcase both progress on climate and looming threats in stops at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Honolulu, and an ocean refuge in the remote Midway Atoll. \nOn Saturday, he will discuss further steps on climate change with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is hosting the summit of the G20 group of leading economies, where climate is part of the agenda. \nObama and Xi worked together to secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions at a Paris conference last year and are expected to take the next steps soon to help bring the agreement into force. \nAt a Nevada summit on the health of Lake Tahoe, known for its clarity, Obama will talk about drought, wildfires and gains the United States has made in renewable energy. He will point to U.S. carbon emissions that are at their lowest level in almost two decades, the White House said. \n\"He has not backed off,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is hosting the summit. \n\"He is somebody who has been unrelenting in recognizing that climate change is not a scientific hoax,\" Reid said in an interview. \nGreen groups have cheered Obama but also are prodding him not to rest on his laurels. \n\"We’re hoping that he will actually withdraw the Arctic from his five-year plan on offshore drilling, like he did with the Atlantic, because it’s an even worse place to drill, frankly,\" said Jackie Savitz, a marine biologist with the Oceana conservation group. \nLater on Wednesday, Obama will speak with leaders of Pacific Island nations at risk from climate change and a congress of conservation leaders in Honolulu. \nLast week, he quadrupled the size of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii, banning commercial fishing and drilling from a huge area known for its coral reefs, sharks and seals. \nHe will venture deep into the monument on Thursday during a rare presidential stop at Midway Atoll, where climate advocates hope the pictures tell the story. \n\"Having the president standing in a place that could disappear would be a powerful message on climate change and ocean health,\" said Seth Horstmeyer, a director with Pew's Global Ocean Legacy project. \n(Additional reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Bill Trott) Trending Stories",

	      "text": "Story highlights Pollution, residents cleared out in preparation for China's big G20 debut in Hangzhou China wants to focus on economic issues, rather than the South China Sea dispute (CNN) World leaders touch down in the Chinese city of Hangzhou this week for the G20 summit and Beijing is determined it will proceed without a hitch.\nFactories are shuttered, skies are clear and security is tight. Local residents have been given seven days extra vacation time and discounted tours to destinations outside the city to ensure Hangzhou is free of crowds and traffic. Meanwhile, thousands of migrant workers have left the city due to the halt in their work lives and the growing inconvenience caused by G20 preparation measures. What will be discussed at the summit? How has China prepared? And why is it in Hangzhou anyway? Here's five things you need to know. Read More China takes the lead The Hangzhou meeting will be the first G20 China has hosted, and only the second held in Asia since 2008. The G20's first high-profile meeting was in Washington D.C. in 2008 , after the fall of Lehman Brothers bank and the start of the global financial crisis. An alternative to the more exclusive G7, it was designed as a way to create conversation at the top levels of international government and try to ensure disasters, like the financial crisis, were avoided in the future. The Hangzhou summit has been called another \"milestone\" for a rising China, keen to show its growing dominance on the world stage. It's an opportunity for President Xi Jinping to burnish his diplomatic credentials. He'll meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and it will likely be his last bilateral meeting with US President Barack Obama. Photos: China's best public bike system – While the rest of the country is moving from two wheels to four, cycling culture is thriving in Hangzhou. The city has the world's biggest public bike system, offering more than 84,000 bicycles for rent. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: West Lake – A stroll along the 12,000-acre West Lake in Hangzhou city center is all it takes to understand why the city is called \"paradise on earth.\" Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Mountain getaways – About 40 kilometers away from the city center, Qiandai Resort sits on Jing Mountain. The low-profile resort doesn't have a website, though it does have a WeChat account (China's version of Whatsapp/Facebook). Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Zen – Surrounded by lush trees, Lingyin Temple is a pocket of calm a short ride from the city center. It's one of the country's oldest and most important Buddhist monasteries. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Silk – Hangzhou is known as the city of silk. Scarves are the city's most popular silk souvenir, highlighting its cutting-edge dyeing techniques. The industry leader is Wensli , a homegrown silk brand. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Longjing tea – Hangzhou is home to some of China's finest -- and priciest -- tea leaves. The village of Longjing is where tea leaves were grown for China's ancient emperor. Tea-picking season is usually around late March to April, when travelers from across the country visit the village for quality tea leaves. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Hangzhou cuisine – Unlike dishes from northern China, heavy in sauces and spices, Hangzhou cuisine -- also known as Hangbang cai -- is mild but flavorful with a focus on fresh ingredients. Longjing shrimp is Hangzhou's signature dish. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Alibaba – Nicknamed China's Silicon Valley, Hangzhou is home to Jack Ma, the founder and chairman of Alibaba Group and the second-richest man in China. Alibaba, the world's leading e-commerce group, has transformed Ma's hometown into a high-tech metropolis. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: China Art Academy – Hangzhou's China Art Academy has seen some of the country's most celebrated Chinese artists pass through its halls. The head of its architecture school, Wang Shu, brought home China's first Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2012. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Fans – It's said that tea, silk and hand fans are Hangzhou's three unparalleled gifts. The most iconic fans are by Wang Xing Ji. Established in 1875, this time-honored brand has charmed tourists and locals alike with its intricately designed fans. Hide Caption 10 of 10 No effort spared China is not taking any chances with the showpiece event -- Hangzhou is in \"virtual lockdown,\" according to CNN's Andrew Stevens, in the lead-up to the arrival of world leaders on Friday. A security checkpoint at the West Lake scenic spot in Hangzhou. Police officers and security guards will be stationed every five to 10 meters at popular attractions like the city's West Lake, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. \"Security is tight and getting tighter,\" Stevens said, adding his camera crew were stopped multiple times and asked for their credentials. One migrant worker told CNN that authorities had confiscated the gas tank his family uses for cooking, saying it didn't meet safety standards. \"Ordinary people suffer. It's really affected our daily lives,\" said Xu, who didn't want to give his full name. Hangzhou: Innovation capital? Hangzhou wasn't just chosen to host the G20 because of its natural beauty -- it's also symbolic as a marker of China's transition from a low-cost manufacturer to high-tech economy. E-commerce group Alibaba, one of China's largest companies and most successful start-ups, was founded in Hangzhou, the hometown of founder Jack Ma. Alipay -- Alibaba's mobile payment application -- has changed the way Chinese people shop. Chinese residents can easily get by without a wallet as the app allows them to pay bills with a simple swipe of their smart phones -- even at the smallest street restaurants and vegetable vendors. \"We're pretty small city, only have close to nine million people but Hangzhou is so powerful, so influential to China's economy, to China's culture,\" Ma told Alibaba's news services Alizila. President Xi has a history with the city as well -- he lived in Hangzhou for five years while serving as the province's Communist Party chief and is said to be fond of his time there. 10 things Hangzhou does best G20 blue Hangzhou is renowned as one of China's most beautiful cities, but, like many places in China, it struggles with pollution, ranking 43 out of 74 cities in a 2014 study by Greenpeace. But in the lead-up to the G20, the sky has cleared as polluting industries have been shut down or moved for the international meeting's duration. Some 225 factories have been ordered to close and traffic will also be restricted, with half the city's vehicles barred from roads from August 28. The China Daily said an upper limit of PM2.5 particles, one of the worst pollutants, was set at 35 micrograms per cubic meter during the summit. The average PM2.5 level in Hangzhou in 2014 was 66.1. Nearby cities of Huangshan, Anqing, Yiwu and even Shanghai are also cleaning up their factories, according to Chinese media. It's a pattern seen before other big ticket events. In 2014, Beijing residents coined the wry phrase \"APEC blue\" after authorities went all out to ensure clear skies before the powwow of Asia Pacific leaders and last September the skies turned \"parade blue\" as Beijing hosted a massive military parade. Images taken from CNN's Beijing bureau on November 6, when the sky was blue during the APEC summit, and on November 19 when the smog returned. The elephant in the room? It's been less than three months since China lost to the Philippines in an international court case over its contested territorial claims in the South China Sea. But at the G20 in Hangzhou, the host country will be working hard to keep it off the agenda. Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong said it will be focusing on economic issues, according to government mouthpiece China Daily , rather than security. In a separate editorial, the Global Times wrote the Hangzhou summit \"shouldn't be distracted by sea spat.\"",

	      "text": "Down Ticket is Yahoo News’ complete guide to the most fascinating House, Senate and governors’ races of 2016. Coming to you every Tuesday and Thursday until Nov. 8. What you need to know today.\nHappy Florida Primary Day! Here are four storylines to watch as the results come rolling in. If we had to pick just one state to watch for the rest of this election cycle, Florida would be it.\nForget about the marquee slugfest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. As\n“SNL’s” Stefon might say, the Sunshine State’s down-ballot races have everything :\n– A former GOP White House candidate, Marco Rubio, who solemnly vowed not to run for reelection to the Senate this year — then decided to do it anyway.\n– A Democratic Senate primary between a guy who has been accused of padding his résumé (Rep. Patrick Murphy) and a guy who has been accused of abusing his now ex-wife (Rep. Alan Grayson).\n– A race for the latter’s U.S. House seat that features both his current wife, Dena Grayson, and one of his top congressional aides, Susannah Randolph.\n– A Democratic congresswoman, Corrine Brown, who is running for reelection while simultaneously being tried in a federal corruption case .\n– Another Democratic House contest that pits a former candidate for lieutenant governor, Annette Taddeo, against her close friend and mentor, Joe Garcia. Garcia is a former congressman whose chief of staff was sent to jail in 2013 for orchestrating a fraudulent ballot scheme .\n– A former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, who is now running for the House as a Democrat .\n– And a recently dethroned chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, fighting for her political life against a nationwide movement of disgruntled progressives — including her party’s 2016 presidential runner-up, Bernie Sanders.\nNot to mention the fact that 24 of the state’s 27 congressional districts were redrawn last year after the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the old map was unconstitutional.\nIt’s basically the electoral version of the Florida Man meme, except with serious implications for control of Congress and the political direction of the nation as a whole.\nOh, and the Sunshine State’s primaries are today — meaning the fall campaigns are about to begin in earnest. If you haven’t tuned in yet, now is the time.\nHere are four storylines to watch — all of them with national implications — as Floridians go to the polls.\n1. Can anyone else pull a Trump?\nDonald Trump may have defeated Marco Rubio by a dizzying 19 percentage points in Florida’s March 15 presidential primary — even though Rubio is a Florida native who has held elected office in the state, in one capacity or another, for nearly 15 years. But that doesn’t mean Trump’s signature blend of hard-edged nativism and politically incorrect bomb-throwing is producing the same sort of results for Republicans who aren’t Donald Trump.\nQuite the opposite, actually.\nTake Carlos Beruff. When Rubio reversed himself and entered the Florida Senate race at the last minute — literally two days before the June 22 deadline — most of the other GOP candidates dutifully stepped aside.\nView photos\nCarlos Beruff announcing his candidacy in February. (Photo: Giorgio Viera/El Nuevo Herald/TNS via Getty Images) More Not Beruff. Instead, the wealthy Manatee County developer doubled down on his Donald impression, cutting attack ads that claim Rubio isn’t as tough as Trump; proposing a ban on all Middle Eastern immigrants (except Israelis); and tweeting stuff like “I won’t read a bunch of crap off a teleprompter.” He even parrots one of Trump’s catchphrases: “ it’s time to put America first .” The Miami New Times called Beruff “the Cuban-American Donald Trump”; Roll Call labeled him “Little Trump of Florida.”\nThe only problem? Beruff is going to lose on Tuesday — by a lot. The latest polls show him trailing Rubio by 30 to 60 points.\nIt’s a result that, along with similar outcomes in various other contests, “casts serious doubt on the existence of Trumpism minus Trump,” writes Frank Bruni .\nOr, at the very least, it casts serious doubt on the existence of Trumpism minus a candidate who’s already famous in his or her right. So far, the lesson of this cycle is that if you’re a Beruff or a Paul Nehlen — Paul Ryan’s unsuccessful primary challenger — and you’re running against an incumbent as well-known as Rubio or Ryan, then you’re going to lose every time.\nIn other words, the usual laws of politics still apply — no matter how slavishly you imitate the Donald.\n2. Are Democrats blowing their big opportunity?\nLast Thursday, the New York Times published a story headlined “ Democrats’ Weak Bench Undermines Hope of Taking Back Senate .”\n“Senate Democrats, aware of the dead weight that Donald J. Trump has placed on their vulnerable Republican colleagues, can taste a reclaimed majority,” it began. “But just as Senate Republicans blew their chances in 2010 and 2012 before finally taking control in 2014, Democrats find themselves hobbled by less-than-stellar candidates in races that could make the difference in winning a majority.”\nFlorida may be one of those races.\nThe primary between Orlando Rep. Alan Grayson and Treasure Coast Rep. Patrick Murphy has been one of the nastiest in recent Florida history — and that’s saying something. Grayson has called Murphy a “dishonest” “Republican sock puppet” and slammed him for “ inflating his résumé, for asking state officials to delay an announcement about the opening of a center to assist businesses affected by a toxic algae bloom, and for voting with Republicans on key issues .”\nMeanwhile, Murphy has repeatedly dismissed and disparaged Grayson, a left-wing firebrand, after allegations of a two-decade pattern of domestic abuse surfaced in Politico last month .\nView photos\nPatrick Murphy and Alan Grayson (Photos: Steve Cannon/AP) More Not that the confrontational, bombastic Grayson — a pol who once described a lobbyist as a “K Street whore”; who has accused Republicans of wanting Americans to “die quickly”; and who is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for running his hedge fund while in office — was particularly popular with mainstream Democrats before that. Both Barack Obama and Joe Biden have taken the unusual step of endorsing Murphy, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has publicly told Grayson, “ I want you to lose .”\nMurphy leads Grayson by a wide margin in the latest polls and is likely to win Tuesday — even as he trails Rubio in every survey released since the incumbent inserted himself into the race .\nSometimes rocky primaries strengthen candidates. But that doesn’t seem to have been the case with Murphy (who is also being hounded by Republicans for receiving hefty financial support from his rich father at every stage of his career ).\n“It’s highly bitter and highly personal,” Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida, recently told the Orlando Sentinel . “It parallels what you see on every level, and it’s why so many people are tired of this election. The tone is just wearing on people.”\nEven more worrisome for Democrats than the timbre of this particular contest is the likelihood that it won’t be the last of its kind.\nIn the New York Times, Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor and Senate analyst for the Cook Political Report, predicted that as Bernie Sanders-inspired progressives continue to challenge establishment favorites like Murphy, “Democrats are going to have their own Tea Party moment in 2018.” And with Republicans now controlling 68 of 98 partisan state legislative chambers, the highest number in GOP history, the Democratic bench is thinner than ever before — which means that Murphy won’t be the last flawed candidate the party is forced to support.\n3. Can Bernie defeat Debbie?\nSpeaking of Sanders, voters in Florida’s 23rd Congressional District will finally decide Tuesday whether to heed the senator’s call to sack the controversial Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nSanders has been at war with the former Democratic National Committee chair for months, first accusing her of rigging the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton and then, in the wake of last month’s DNC email hack, leading the charge that led to her resignation from the party’s top post. All along, he’s been ginning up support for Wasserman Schultz’s challenger, a law professor named Tim Canova, via his powerful email list and fundraising operation.\nView photos\nTim Canova joins union members at a Verizon protest in May. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images) More So far, Canova has received $3.8 million in Sanders-driven donations, even as Sanders himself has declined to stump for Canova in person.\nAll that money and proxy-war publicity have transformed Canova into a more credible challenger than anyone expected. But he still trails Wasserman Schultz by 10 percentage points in a heavily Jewish area where Clinton clobbered Sanders with more than 70 percent of the vote — and where Wasserman Schultz has won every election since 1992.\nCanova is unlikely to break that streak Tuesday — suggesting that however popular Sanders was on a presidential level, he still has a long way to go before he “revolutionizes” the Democratic Party.\n4. Will turnout change the game?\nThere’s still a chance, however, that Canova — and other legislative candidates across the state — could shock observers with upset victories this week.\nWhy? A fascinating new turnout trend. Ace Florida political reporter Adam Smith has the details :\nAlmost half of the mail ballots returned so far for Tuesday’s primary election have come from Floridians who voted in either one or zero of the past four primary elections. That means a big, decisive chunk of the vote will come from people who have not been polled, and potentially not courted, targeted or accounted for by countless campaigns across the state. …\nAs of Thursday morning, more than 855,000 primary ballots had been cast by mail. More than a quarter of those votes came from Floridians who had not voted in the last four primaries and another 20 percent from people who voted in just one of the last four primaries.\nIn other words, these are not “likely voters” surveyed by most pollsters or targeted by sophisticated political campaigns. The trend applies to Democrats and Republicans alike and across the state.\nDriven by the new ease of absentee voting — Floridians now automatically receive ballots — and widespread frustration with the presidential clash between Trump and Clinton, voters who declined to participate in earlier primaries are suddenly weighing in. That could render some preprimary polling inaccurate and produce surprise results in any number of close races.\nCanova, for one, is counting on it. “Our ground game is so big” — four field offices, 40 paid staffers, hundreds of volunteers — “that we’ve really expanded the field,” he recently told NBC News .\nView photos\nA voter hands in his absentee ballot. (Photo: Alan Diaz/AP) More “This is huge,” said Marian Johnson, senior vice president of political strategy for the Florida Chamber of Commerce (the first group to notice the uptick in unlikely voters). “I can envision election night when the votes are counted that certain people win that nobody thought had a chance, and that being attributed to this trend.”\nIn a state with more competitive House races than anywhere except for California or New York — including what promises to be a fierce battle in Florida’s 26th Congressional District between endangered GOP incumbent Carlos Curbelo and whoever wins Tuesday’s Democratic primary between former Rep. Joe Garcia and his mentee, Annette Taddeo — upsets Tuesday could either help or hinder the Democratic Party’s long-shot campaign to recapture control of the lower chamber of Congress.\nMeanwhile, in Arizona… Florida isn’t the only state that’s holding its primaries today; Arizona is also heading to the polls.\nThis year’s marquee battle is the GOP Senate primary pitting five-term incumbent John McCain against former state Sen. Kelli Ward. McCain’s relationship with the state GOP has been tempestuous; in 2014, the state party formally censured him for breaking with conservatives on key issues, calling his record “disastrous and harmful.” Polls taken around the same time showed that more Arizona Republicans disapproved (55 percent) than approved (35 percent) of his performance in office.\nView photos\nKelli Ward, right, who is running against Sen. John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary, talks to voters. (Photo: Ross D. Franklin/AP) More Ward embodies the right’s dissatisfaction with McCain. A 47-year-old doctor of osteopathic medicine, she has taken a Trumpian approach to the incumbent, slamming him as a pro-immigrant, pro-war creature of the establishment who is virtually indistinguishable from Hillary Clinton . Ward has even suggested that McCain, 80, might die in office.\n“I’m a doctor,” Ward told Politico. “The life expectancy of the American male is not 86. It’s less.”\n(Fun fact: Ward is correct if you measure life expectancy at birth, averaging in all the people who die young, but as FactCheck.org points out , an American male who is already 80 can be expected to live another eight years.)\nThe race is closer than analysts expected it to be — and McCain isn’t taking anything for granted . Still, barring a stunning upset, McCain should win — though perhaps by single digits, which would be the closest margin of his career. Bruised, the senator would then proceed to his second tough race of the year: a general election contest against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a well-funded, well-prepared Democrat.\nAnd he would still have to deal with Donald Trump.\nTrump has dogged McCain all year. The senator technically supports his party’s nominee, though in the most tepid terms imaginable; Trump, meanwhile, has insulted McCain at every turn. As a result, Ward is attacking McCain for being insufficiently gung-ho about the Donald — and therefore insufficiently conservative — and Kirkpatrick is saying that a true maverick would never bow before a guy who once mocked his heroic service in Vietnam .\nIt’s a rock-and-a-hard-place situation for McCain, and one that will likely persist through Nov. 8; the senator has promised that he won’t turn on Trump in the general.\n“No, there’s no reason to do that,” McCain said last week . “They all know me. Everybody in Arizona really knows me unless they just moved in.”\nView photos\nSen. John McCain and his wife, Cindy, leave a polling station after voting on Tuesday. (Photo: Matt York/AP) More On to the House. To run against McCain, Kirkpatrick had to vacate her seat in Arizona’s First Congressional District, which runs from Flagstaff to the northern Tucson suburbs. The contest to replace her is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country. Democrat Tom O’Halleran is expected to easily win Tuesday’s Democratic primary, but no less than five Republicans — Springerville rancher and businessman Gary Kiehne, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, retired Air Force pilot Wendy Rogers, Navajo Nation businessman Shawn Redd — are battling to face off against him in November. Arizona’s First District is one of only three Democratic-held House tossups this year , so whoever wins Tuesday will have the rare chance to pick up a seat for the GOP.\nArizona’s Second Congressional District, which includes parts of Tucson and Cochise County, is also worth watching. There, Democrats Matt Heinz and Victoria Steele are vying to challenge incumbent U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, a first-term Republican who won by a mere 167 votes in 2014.\nThe best of the rest DSCC (+D Super PAC) delay ad spending on Ohio Senate race https://t.co/4srHCqLJUo #OHSEN\n— Michael LaRosa (@MichaelLaRosaDC) August 30, 2016\nMcCain explains why he will keep supporting, and criticizing, Donald Trump.

	      "text": "Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump in Wisconsin, two polls found Trump is strongest with white men but Clinton leads among all other groups Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump in Wisconsin, but the race has clearly tightened in recent weeks, two new polls show. A Monmouth University survey of likely voters shows Clinton's lead is 43% to Trump's 38% -- with 7% backing Libertarian Gary Johnson and 3% supporting Green Party nominee Jill Stein. And a Marquette University Law School poll finds Clinton's lead with likely voters is 45% to Trump's 42%. In a four-way matchup, it's 37% Clinton, 32% Trump, 11% Johnson, 7% Stein and 13% undecided. Those results are much tighter than the findings from the last Marquette poll in early August. That one found Clinton ahead by 15 points among likely voters. What it means: Clinton's post-convention bump in Wisconsin is gone. Read More Trump's strongest spot is with white men, with whom he leads 51% to 29%, the Monmouth poll found. But he trails 50% to 33% among white women, and Clinton leads 67% to 12% among black, Hispanic and Asian voters. \"The current presidential election race in Wisconsin is looking a lot like the 2012 contest right now,\" said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University Polling Institute. That year, President Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney, 53% to 46%. Monmouth's survey included 404 likely Wisconsin voters. It was conducted August 27-30, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. The Marquette Law poll included 650 likely voters. It was conducted August 25-28 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 points. Both polls found good news for Democrats on the Senate front. Democratic challenger Russ Feingold leads Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson, 54% to 41%, according to the Monmouth poll. The Marquette Law result was tighter, showing Feingold leading Johnson, 48% to 45%, among likely voters. Sections",

	      "title": "Africa's elephants rapidly declining as poaching thrives",
	      "text": "HONOLULU (AP) — The number of savanna elephants in Africa is rapidly declining and the animals are in danger of being wiped out as international and domestic ivory trades drive poaching across the continent, according to a study released Wednesday. Africa's savanna elephant population plummeted by about 30 percent from 2007 to 2014 and is declining at about 8 percent a year, said a survey funded by Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen.\n\"If we can't save the African elephant, what is the hope of conserving the rest of Africa's wildlife?\" elephant ecologist Mike Chase, the lead researcher, said in a statement. \"I am hopeful that, with the right tools, research, conservation efforts and political will, we can help conserve elephants for decades to come.\"\nThe aerial survey covered 18 countries using dozens of airplanes to fly the equivalent of going to the moon and partway back. The study, known as the Great Elephant Census and involving 90 scientists, estimated a population of 352,271 savanna elephants.\nOverall, researchers spotted about 12 carcasses for every 100 live elephants, indicating poaching at a high enough level to cause population decline. But the rates were much higher than that in some countries.\nAngola, Mozambique and Tanzania experienced greater population declines than previously known, and elephants face local extinction in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and Zambia, the study said. It also says numbers of elephants in South Africa, Uganda and parts of Malawi and Kenya were stable or partly increasing.\nResults of the study were announced ahead of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in Honolulu.\nAllen, who provided $7 million for the effort, said he decided to launch the census after hearing three years ago that there had not been a comprehensive count of African elephants in decades.\n\"I took my first trip to Africa in 2006 and have been fascinated by elephants ever since,\" he said. \"They are intelligent, expressive and dignified — but not to be underestimated. So, as this latest poaching crisis began escalating, I felt compelled to do something about it.\"\nThe research team used the limited existing data as a baseline for the study. But this survey is more comprehensive and will serve as a more reliable baseline for future observations, the team said.\nIts methodology involves manually counting animals while maintaining a specific altitude and following calibrated strips of land below the plane. The method is widely used for surveying animals on large plots of land and was the most accurate method of three tested on a known population in Africa, Chase said. The team also used video surveillance when counting big herds.\nIvory trading that threatens elephants is banned internationally. But the domestic trade of ivory within countries is legal nearly everywhere.\nA motion being considered at the Hawaii conference seeks to change that by gaining international consensus to close all domestic ivory markets, noting that illegal killing of elephants for their tusks threatens national security, hinders economic development and endangers those tasked with protecting the animals.\nU.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced their commitment last year to combatting wildlife trafficking. The leaders promised to work toward a nearly complete ban on ivory imports and exports and an end to the domestic ivory trade.\nThe decline in savanna elephants, like the dwindling numbers of African forest elephants, is directly tied to criminal poaching activities, some with ties to terrorist groups, according to Washington's nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency.\n\"Trade in ivory has been a driver of destabilization wherever it occurs in Africa,\" agency President Allan Thornton said.\nThornton said one-time auctions of stockpiled ivory to China and Japan in 2008 resulted in a spike in illegal poaching, and the rate of decline among Africa's elephants has been accelerating since.\nIn areas with a high rate of population decline, the savanna turns into an overgrown thicket devoid of grasslands that sustain other wildlife and becomes overrun by disease-carrying tsetse flies, said James Deutsch, director of Allen's Vulcan Inc. Wildlife Conservation.\nFurthermore, that land becomes useless for tourism when the elephants are removed, he said.\n\"Once you remove elephants from parks, it becomes very hard to gain the political will to maintain those parks,\" Deutsch said.\nU.N. Environment deputy head Ibrahim Thiaw said African nations are realizing that wildlife is worth saving because it brings in tourist dollars to fund education, health care and infrastructure.\n\"As depressing as these numbers are, I hope they act as a further spark for action and change,\" Thiaw said in a statement. \"The Great Elephant Census tells us we must act, and now.\"\n___\nFind more stories by AP's Caleb Jones at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/caleb-jones .

	      "text": "Clemency changes to free drug offenders 01:30 Read More Over two decades ago, Corey, now 47, began dealing drugs with a small group of college friends in Virginia. Though Corey was not a kingpin, he received an essential death sentence largely because three of his co-conspirators testified against him in exchange for reduced sentences. Due to federal laws, Corey was held accountable for all \"reasonably foreseeable\" quantities of drugs attributed to the five other people involved in the conspiracy. Absolutely no dimension of his conduct was violent. Despite facing the grim reality of dying in prison, Corey has worked diligently to prove that he is deserving of a second chance. He has devoted himself to extensive rehabilitative programming, completed three self-improvement residential programs and received over 100 learning certificates that have enhanced his education and personal development. Corey is the only defendant on his case still behind bars after a co-defendant, who was also serving life without parole, received an unquestionably deserving grant of clemency from President Barack Obama in May of this year. How can we end the cycle of racial violence? Notably, Judge Henry Coke Morgan Jr., who sentenced Corey to life in prison under mandatory sentencing laws, believes that Corey also deserves clemency. In a letter supporting Corey's pending clemency petition, Morgan confirmed he is \"certain\" that he \" would not have imposed a life sentence on [Corey] had the laws at the time not virtually mandated it.\" While there is little doubt that a prison sentence was warranted in Corey's case, he doesn't deserve to die in a cell because of it. Life in prison without the possibility of parole is, short of execution, the harshest punishment available in America. It screams that a person is beyond hope, beyond redemption. It suffocates mass potential as it buries people alive. And, in Corey's case, it is a punishment that does not fit the crime. Recently, I went to visit Corey in prison to discuss his pending clemency petition. As I sat in the bleak, cold concrete interior of the attorney-client visiting room, I was struck by Corey's remorse, intelligence and dedication to bettering himself. I learned Corey is an avid meditator. He mentioned how he once read nature could enhance the meditation experience, but he had not seen a tree in years. The prison yard is surrounded by daunting, gray brick buildings. The rest of our conversation was a blur because I could not move past the fact that he had not seen a tree. A tree. Though I never imagined that visiting a United States Penitentiary would change the trajectory of my legal career, the state of consciousness I achieved after meeting Corey empowered me. I no longer wanted to be just a lawyer. I wanted to use this platform to promote the greater good. Because of thousands of cases like Corey's, three months ago I resigned from my corporate law job to become a full-time advocate for criminal justice reform. JUST WATCHED",

	      "text": "By Jonathan Landay WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and its negotiating partners agreed \"in secret\" to allow Iran to evade some restrictions in last year's landmark nuclear agreement in order to meet the deadline for it to start getting relief from economic sanctions, according to a report reviewed by Reuters.\nThe report is to be published on Thursday by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, said the think tank’s president David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector and co-author of the report. It is based on information provided by several officials of governments involved in the negotiations, who Albright declined to identify.\nReuters could not independently verify the report's assertions.\n\"The exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favor Iran,\" Albright said.\nAmong the exemptions were two that allowed Iran to exceed the deal's limits on how much low-enriched uranium (LEU) it can keep in its nuclear facilities, the report said. LEU can be purified into highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium.\nThe exemptions, the report said, were approved by the joint commission the deal created to oversee implementation of the accord. The commission is comprised of the United States and its negotiating partners -- called the P5+1 -- and Iran.\nOne senior \"knowledgeable\" official was cited by the report as saying that if the joint commission had not acted to create these exemptions, some of Iran’s nuclear facilities would not have been in compliance with the deal by Jan. 16, the deadline for the beginning of the lifting of sanctions.\nThe U.S. administration has said that the world powers that negotiated the accord -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- made no secret arrangements.\nA White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the joint commission and its role were \"not secret.\" He did not address the report's assertions of exemptions.\nDiplomats at the United Nations for the other P5+1 countries did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the report.\nThe report's assertions are likely to anger critics of the nuclear deal. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to renegotiate the agreement if he's elected, while Democrat Hillary Clinton supports the accord.\nAlbright said the exceptions risked setting precedents that Iran could use to seek additional waivers.\nAlbright served as an inspector with the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team that investigated former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons program.\nWhile Albright has neither endorsed nor denounced the overall agreement, he has expressed concern over what he considers potential flaws in the nuclear deal, including the expiration of key limitations on Iran's nuclear work in 10-15 years.\nEXEMPTIONS ON URANIUM, \"HOT CELLS\"\nThe administration of President Barack Obama informed Congress of the exemptions on Jan. 16, said the report. Albright said the exemptions, which have not been made public, were detailed in confidential documents sent to Capitol Hill that day -- after the exemptions had already been granted.\nThe White House official said the administration had briefed Congress \"frequently and comprehensively\" on the joint commission's work.\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez, a leading critic of the Iran deal and a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters in an email: \"I was not aware nor did I receive any briefing (on the exemptions).”\nAs part of the concessions that allowed Iran to exceed uranium limits, the joint commission agreed to exempt unknown quantities of 3.5 percent LEU contained in liquid, solid and sludge wastes stored at Iranian nuclear facilities, according to the report. The agreement restricts Iran to stockpiling only 300 kg of 3.5 percent LEU.\n    The commission approved a second exemption for an unknown quantity of near 20 percent LEU in \"lab contaminant\" that was determined to be unrecoverable, the report said. The nuclear agreement requires Iran to fabricate all such LEU into research reactor fuel.\nIf the total amount of excess LEU Iran possesses is unknown, it is impossible to know how much weapons-grade uranium it could yield, experts said.\nThe draft report said the joint commission also agreed to allow Iran to keep operating 19 radiation containment chambers larger than the accord set. These so-called \"hot cells\" are used for handling radioactive material but can be \"misused for secret, mostly small-scale plutonium separation efforts,\" said the report. Plutonium is another nuclear weapons fuel.\nThe deal allowed Iran to meet a 130-tonne limit on heavy water produced at its Arak facility by selling its excess stock on the open market. But with no buyer available, the joint commission helped Tehran meet the sanctions relief deadline by allowing it to send 50 tonnes of the material -- which can be used in nuclear weapons production -- to Oman, where it was stored under Iranian control, the report said.\nThe shipment to Oman of the heavy water that can be used in nuclear weapons production has already been reported. Albright's report made the new assertion that the joint committee had approved this concession.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Landay; editing by John Walcott and Stuart Grudgings)",

	      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Wednesday was supposed to be the day Donald Trump clarified his immigration stance. But in a key speech on that subject, he misstated facts about immigration policy, life for those in the country illegally and their impact on the U.S. economy. A look at some of his statements in an Arizona rally in the evening and after a meeting earlier in the day with Mexico's president:\n___\nTRUMP: \"President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.\"\nTHE FACTS: Trump actually praised President Barack Obama in the past for deporting an unprecedented number of people during his first term, a record that does not square with an accusation of supporting an \"open\" border.\nObama increased Border Patrol staffing to an all-time high of 21,444 agents in 2011 and his administration has virtually ended the practice of \"voluntary returns,\" or turning back Mexicans without any consequences.\nBoth Obama and Clinton support a more lenient policy than Trump has proposed, but what they lay out is not an open border.\nClinton has promised to extend Obama's actions that would let people brought to the country illegally as children remain in the country, as well as to let some parents of U.S. citizens stay. Both seek legislation that would allow most of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to stay if they pass a background check, learn English and pay taxes. However, those who fail the background check or commit crimes would be deported.\n___\nTRUMP, on people illegally in the U.S.: \"They're treated better than our vets.\"\nTHE FACTS: People in the country illegally do not have the right to work, vote or receive most government benefits. A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action but most live under the risk of being removed from the country.\nVeterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits.\nThe quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status.\n___\nTRUMP: \"When politicians talk about immigration reform they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages ... It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\"\nTHE FACTS: No politician of either party who supports overhauling immigration laws supports \"amnesty,\" but the meaning of \"amnesty\" varies depending on who is talking.\nThe sweeping and bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 was derided by opponents as amnesty, but supporters including GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida disputed that, noting numerous requirements imposed on immigrants in the country illegally along a 13-year path to citizenship, including paying penalties.\nThe bill proposed spending tens of billions of dollars to double the number of border patrol agents and greatly increase border security. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied the bill and projected that it would lower wages for the entire workforce slightly over the first 10 years after becoming law, but would then increase wages for the entire workforce by even more, at the same time boosting economic output and increasing the GDP.\n___\nTRUMP, on the number of people in the U.S. illegally: \"Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\"\nTHE FACTS: The government actually has an idea. The Homeland Security Department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate.\nThe figure comes from an analysis of the most recent Census Data. The government compares the number of people whom the Census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government.\nExperts believe the number of people in the U.S. illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle.\n___\nTRUMP, on ending the practice of releasing people who are caught crossing the border illegally, pending a court appearance: \"We are going to end catch-and-release ... Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\"\nTHE FACTS: Many of the releases in question were ordered by courts. They were not a policy of the Obama administration.\nA federal judge in Los Angeles ruled last year the federal government's detention of children and their mothers who were caught crossing the border illegally violated a 1997 court settlement. In July, an appeals court narrowed the scope, saying children must be quickly released but not their parents. From October through July, 48,311 unaccompanied children were arrested crossing the border from Mexico; many more children were caught with their families.\nMany crossing the border illegally claim asylum, which must be adjudicated by an immigration judge. People can claim asylum because they are being persecuted or fear persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion.\n___\nTRUMP, on preventing people from overstaying their visas and remaining in the country illegally: \"We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action. Never happens, never happens ... In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place.\"\nTHE FACTS: Trump is correct in focusing on visa overstays as a source of much illegal immigration. The biometric system he wants to complete, though, presents enormous logistical, technical and financial challenges, and he gave no details how he would address it differently than his predecessors.\nCongress mandated the system first in 1996 and only now has the Obama administration begun implementing it on select flights at nine airports and at a border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.\nThe scope of the problem is immense - and not one that Trump's proposed border wall could fix.\nThe U.S. admits more than 45 million people annually on tourist, student and work visas. The government says 99 percent of them leave when required. But 1 percent overstay their visas, and that's more than 450,000 people annually.\n___\nTRUMP, after meeting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto: \"I shared my strong view that NAFTA has been a far greater benefit to Mexico than it has been to the United States and that it must be improved upon. ... I expressed that ... we must take action to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country. It's happening every day, it's getting worse and worse and worse, and we have to stop it.\"\nTHE FACTS: The loss of manufacturing jobs is generally attributed to China, not Mexico.\nSome U.S. companies have moved jobs to Mexico — the Carrier Corp. recently decided to relocate an air conditioning factory there from Indiana. But there is little data to show that the trend is getting \"worse and worse.\"\nNo reliable annual measures exist of job flows between the U.S. and Mexico. The United States hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, when more than 5.5 million were lost, but most economists blame the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse and the increasing automation of many factories.\nRecently, manufacturing has done a bit better: Since 2010, U.S. manufacturing jobs have increased by about 900,000. And many economists credit NAFTA with helping the U.S. auto industry by providing a cheap source of parts that otherwise might have been sourced in China. A report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that imports of subsidized U.S. agricultural products put as many as 2 million Mexican farmers out of work. And since NAFTA's implementation in 1994, Mexico has grown more slowly than many of its Latin American counterparts.\n___\nTRUMP: \"We didn't discuss that. We didn't discuss who pays for the wall, we didn't discuss.\" ... \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date.\"\nPENA NIETO on Twitter, in Spanish: \"At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\"\nTHE FACTS: The facts may depend on what your definition of a discussion is. If the Mexican president opened with a comment that his country won't pay for the wall and Trump did not respond to it, that may not have been a discussion in his mind. But the subject, it seems, came up. The Trump campaign's brief statement on the meeting did not quibble with Pena Nieto's account. It said the meeting \"was not a negotiation.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Christopher S. Rugaber contributed to this report.
